<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A WORRIED GIRL</h3>
</div>

<p>Four girls sat on four chairs, in four different
corners of the room. They sat on the chairs because
they were really too tired to stand longer,
and the reason for the occupancy of the corners
of the apartment was self-evident. There was no
other available space. For the center of the
chamber was littered to overflowing with trunks,
suitcases and valises, in various stages of being
packed, and from them overflowed a variety of
garments and other accessories of a journey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Cora Kimball, as she gazed
helplessly about, &#8220;will we ever be finished, Bess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the equally discouraging
reply. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem so; does it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t get another thing in my suitcase,&#8221;
spoke the smallest girl of all, who seemed
to shrink back rather timidly into her corner, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
though she feared she might be put into a trunk
by mistake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marita! You simply must get more in
your suitcase!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, starting up.
&#8220;Why, your trunk won&#8217;t begin to hold all the rest
of your things unless you crowd more into the
case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only trouble, Cora,&#8221; sighed Marita, &#8220;is
that the sides and top aren&#8217;t made of rubber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an idea!&#8221; cried a plump girl, in the
corner nearest the piano. &#8220;A rubber suitcase!
What a boon it would be for week-ends, when one
starts off with a Spartan resolution to take only
one extra gown, and ends up with slipping two
party dresses and the &#8216;fixings&#8217; into one&#8217;s trunk.
Oh, for a rubber suitcase!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the sense in sighing after the impossible?&#8221;
asked the girl opposite the plump one.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you finish packing, Bess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221; and the plump one rather
glared at her more frail questioner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, sisters!&#8221; cautioned Cora, as she gazed
at the Robinson twins, &#8220;don&#8217;t get on one another&#8217;s
nerves. Let&#8217;s have another try at it. I&#8217;m sure
if we go at it with some sort of system we&#8217;ll be
able to get all the things in. And really we must
hurry!&#8221; she exclaimed, looking at the clock on the
mantel, which pointed to the hour of four. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
promised to have all the baggage ready for the
man at five. That only gives us an hour&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only an hour!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus the three girls exclaimed in startled tones
as they fairly leaped from their chairs in their respective
corners, and caught up various garments.
</p>
<p>Then, as the apparent hopelessness of the situation
overcame them again, they looked at one another,
at the trunks and suitcases that already held
their fair share of articles, at the accumulation on
the floor, and then they sighed in concert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; spoke Bess Robinson. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going at all&mdash;at least not now. I&#8217;m going to take
another day to sort out the things I really don&#8217;t
need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;Our tickets
are bought, the bungalow is engaged, and we
leave for Crystal Bay on the morning train, if we
have to ship this whole room by freight&mdash;just as
it is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that would be the easiest way,&#8221; suggested
timid Marita Osborne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly would create a sensation in Chelton,&#8221;
murmured Belle, as she looked at her plump
sister. &#8220;But come, we really must help you, Cora.
It&#8217;s too bad we took advantage of your good nature,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
and brought our things here to pack. We
might better have done it at our own homes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think you&#8217;ll find my way best in the
end,&#8221; said Cora, with a smile, as she looked about
for a place in which to pack her sweater. &#8220;By
doing this we won&#8217;t duplicate on the extras. Now,
girls, try once more. Marita, let&#8217;s begin on your
suitcase, for that seems to be the smallest. Oh,
dear, Bess, what are you doing now?&#8221; she called,
as she noted an unusual activity on the part of the
plump girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just seeing if I&#8217;m heavy enough to close
the lid of my trunk,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m
not,&#8221; she exclaimed, as she hopped on and hopped
off again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; called Belle. &#8220;You nearly
stepped on my veil-box, Bess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Sis, but you shouldn&#8217;t leave it on the
floor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plump one stood looking at the bulging
trunk, and then drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m losing weight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked her sister
promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t close my trunk lid. That&#8217;s the way
I can always tell. Problem: Given a trunk, which
requires a force of one hundred and thirty-five
pounds to close down the lid, and a girl of one
hundred and fifteen, how many chocolates must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
the said girl eat before she is heavy enough to
close the lid? Answer&mdash;one pound, and here&#8217;s for
a starter,&#8221; saying which pretty, plump Bess rummaged
in a pile of her belongings until she found
what she was after. Then, sinking down in a
heap of silk petticoats she began munching bonbons
with a contented air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bess Robinson!&#8221; gasped Cora. &#8220;You&#8217;re
never going to do that; are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; came with an innocent air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit there and eat chocolates until you&#8217;re heavy
enough to close down the lid of your trunk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well. I can&#8217;t check it open that
way, and I can&#8217;t close it at my present weight. I
need everything I&#8217;ve squeezed into it; and so what
else can I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only get someone to help us,&#8221;
said Marita, innocently, seeming to take Bess
literally. &#8220;One of the boys&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was interrupted by the laughter of the
others, for Marita was a newcomer in Chelton,
and though Cora and her chums had taken her up,
attracted by her nice ways, Marita did not yet
appreciate her new friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind what Bess says, my dear,&#8221; spoke
Cora, as she saw that Marita was a little hurt at
the laughter. &#8220;As for the boys, please don&#8217;t
suggest such a thing. If they came in now, we&#8217;d
never get through packing. I hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All hope abandon, ye who enter here!&#8221; declaimed
a voice in the doorway, and the faces of
two young men peered in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, as she saw her
brother Jack and his chum, Walter Pennington.
&#8220;The boys are here! Any more of you, Jack?&#8221;
she asked, as she crowded some feminine finery
out of sight behind her back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m going to give general orders for
you to depart at once, and I want to include everyone.
Begone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heartless one!&#8221; murmured Walter, sliding
into the room under Jack&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Just when we
came to help you, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; called Bess, from her position,
Turkish fashion, amid a billowy pile of garments,
&#8220;Help me up first, Wallie, my dear, and then sit
on my trunk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, is that the throne seat?&#8221; he asked, as
he extended his hand, and pretended to find it
extremely difficult to lift Bess to her feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but the lid needs closing, and I can&#8217;t do
it. Sit on it, that&#8217;s a good fellow,&#8221; and she extended
to him a chocolate from the tips of her
fingers, which fingers Walter pretended to bite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you really must go,&#8221; said Cora, seriously,
when Walter had managed to close the trunk.
&#8220;Come, Jack, we have to get through by five
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; and she glanced at her brother, who was
in earnest conversation with Marita in her corner.
</p>
<p>Jack paid no attention to his sister, and Walter
was somewhat surprised to see Bess, after looking
with satisfaction at the trunk he had closed for
her, open it again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; he exclaimed, with pretended
indignation, &#8220;after me nearly breaking
my back to close that lid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted the things compressed, Walter
dear,&#8221; said Bess, sweetly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot more
to put in, and I couldn&#8217;t squeeze in another piece
until they had been crowded down a bit. Now
run along, little boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Jack!&#8221; called Walter, as he turned
to go. &#8220;We have been insulted!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t insult me,&#8221; murmured Jack, never
turning to look at his chum. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be so thin-skinned,
Wal. I&#8217;m having a good time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora&#8217;s girl chums looked at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, you must go!&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Please
do. I should think you boys would have lots to
do to get ready, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All done, Sis,&#8221; murmured Jack. &#8220;We always
travel in light marching order, and sleep on our
arms,&#8221; and he bent closer to the blushing Marita.
</p>
<p>Cora bit her lip. Really she was provoked at
Jack this time. She and her chums were in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
midst of packing for their annual Summer trip,
and to be interrupted this way, at the last critical
moment, was provoking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221; she began. &#8220;I shall tell mother&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he been doing now?&#8221; asked a new
voice, and with a gesture of despair Cora turned
to see another young man in the doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in, Ed,&#8221; called Jack. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know
you were in town. You&#8217;re just in time to assist.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; asked the newcomer.
&#8220;Are you going or coming?&#8221; he inquired, as he
looked at the partially-filled suitcases and trunks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both,&#8221; answered Walter. &#8220;You&#8217;re coming
and they&#8217;re going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; was the comment. &#8220;Hello, Cora&mdash;Bess&mdash;Belle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He paused as he nodded to
each of the girls, and looked questioningly at
Marita in the corner with Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, excuse me,&#8221; murmured Cora. &#8220;Miss
Osborne, let me present to you Mr. Edward Foster&mdash;just
plain Ed, mostly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The plainer the better,&#8221; observed the newcomer,
as he bowed to Marita. &#8220;But what&#8217;s it all
about, Jack?&mdash;No, there&#8217;s no use asking him,&#8221; he
murmured as he noted Cora&#8217;s brother resuming
his interrupted conversation with the little girl.
&#8220;Will someone please enlighten me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our annual flitting,&#8221; sighed Cora. &#8220;And
really half the pleasure is taken away with this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
packing. Well, as long as you boys are here you
might as well make yourselves useful, as well as
ornamental.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted!&#8221; cried Walter, looking about.
&#8220;Where shall I put this?&#8221; and he caught up a box
from the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;You&#8217;ll spill it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Candy?&#8221; he asked questioningly, as he rattled
the contents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My manicure set, and you&#8217;ll have it all upset.
Give it here!&#8221; went on the owner, and Walter
surrendered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but seriously, what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just come home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We girls have taken a bungalow at Crystal
Bay,&#8221; explained Cora. &#8220;We&#8217;re due there to-morrow,
leaving on the early morning train. The
boys, that is, Jack and Walter, are to have a tent
near us, and they&#8217;re supposed to go with us in the
morning. But unless they&#8217;re further along with
their packing than we are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora shrugged her pretty shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Sis, we are!&#8221; Jack threw at her,
without turning his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Camping at Crystal Bay&mdash;that sounds good,&#8221;
murmured Ed, who liked life in the open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you come along, old man?&#8221; asked Walter.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got plenty of room, and we were
counting on you later, when you got back from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
your trip. Now, as long as you&#8217;re here, can&#8217;t you
come with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what I could. Yes, I will.
I haven&#8217;t anything on. I&#8217;ll go home and pack up
right away. You leave in the morning? I guess I
can make it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you go, please take them with
you,&#8221; and Cora indicated her brother and Walter.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll be able to go on with our packing.
Really, Jack,&#8221; and she spoke most seriously this
time, &#8220;you must go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Sis!&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget,&#8221;
he added, to Marita, as he rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense has he been telling you now?&#8221;
asked Belle with a laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t believe him,
Marita.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell!&#8221; cautioned Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s a secret!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somehow the boys were gotten out of the room,
and somehow the girls managed to get through
with their packing in time for the expressman.
</p>
<p>From the Kimball home driveway the expressman
drove with the baggage, and soon the trunks
were rattling down the main street of Chelton,
that pretty New England town, nestling in a bend
of the Chelton River.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s over, thank goodness!&#8221; sighed
Cora, as she saw the baggage safely off. &#8220;Now
to get ourselves ready for morning. You girls
will take supper with me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s too much,&#8221; protested Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, really it isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve told mamma, and she
is counting on you. But I&#8217;m too excited to eat
much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; chorused the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m so anxious to see our new motor
boat!&#8221; added Bess, for the girls had purchased
one that had been sent on ahead to Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do hope Ed can go,&#8221; murmured Belle.
&#8220;He&#8217;s such good company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like him, too,&#8221; confessed Marita, with
a blush, at which the others laughed.
</p>
<p>The boys came over to the Kimball home that
evening, Jack having dined with Walter Pennington.
Ed came also, to say that he could go, and
then the young people talked over plans for Summer
fun, until the chiming of the clock warned the
girls, at least, that they must separate if they were
to get up early the next morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lottie Weaver will meet us at the station,&#8221;
said Cora, referring to another of the party, who
had not assisted at the packing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. If we had had her trunk over
here, with all our things, we&#8217;d never have gotten
the baggage off,&#8221; said Bess, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, after it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; said Cora to
her mother that night, &#8220;I think I would not again
have all the packing done in one place. I thought
it would save time for the girls to bring their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
things here, especially as the Robinsons are so
upset with building that addition to the parlor.
But it was a lot of work!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Mrs. Kimball, &#8220;you meant it
for the best, my dear. I&#8217;m sure you will have a
pleasant Summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They met at the station the next morning&mdash;the
girls and boys. Lottie Weaver was there, in the
glory of a new maroon sweater, and Ed Foster
was also on time.
</p>
<p>The express for Crystal Bay was late, and as
Cora and her motor girl chums marched up and
down the platform, nervously waiting, Cora saw
a girl coming from the waiting room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Freda Lewis!&#8221; she exclaimed, hurrying
up and putting her arms about her. &#8220;What are
you doing here? I thought you were going back
to Bar Harbor for the Summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we were! Oh, Cora! I&#8217;m so glad to see
you. I had to change cars here&mdash;I got on the
wrong train, it seems. I&#8217;ve been traveling all
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it, my dear! Oh, if I had only
known you were here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been waiting long. I&#8217;m to take the
Shore Express.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our train. But, Freda, you don&#8217;t look
at all well&mdash;not a bit as you did at school,&#8221; for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Freda was a chum Cora had made much of a year
or so before, but had not seen of late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not well, Cora,&#8221; said Freda, earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anxiety, mostly. Oh, Cora, we&#8217;ve had such a
dreadful time, mother and I!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her voice trembled pitifully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Freda, dear, what is the matter?&#8221; asked Cora
in sympathetic tones, for she saw tears in the
other&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s money matters. You know we own&mdash;or
at least we thought we did&mdash;a large tract of
land at Crystal Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crystal Bay!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It was Grandfather Lewis&#8217;s homestead.
Well, most of our income has come from that since
father&#8217;s death, and now&mdash;Oh, I don&#8217;t know all the
details, but some land speculators&mdash;land sharks,
mother calls them&mdash;are disputing our title.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother has just worried herself sick over it,
and I&#8217;m afraid she is going into nervous prostration.
I&#8217;ve been to see some distant relatives about
the matter, but I can&#8217;t do anything. I&#8217;m so sorry
for dear little mother. If she should break
down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor, worried Freda could not go on. Cora
held her close and the thought came to her that
Freda herself was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
The girl had changed very much from the
happy, laughing chum of a year before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Freda, dear, tell me more about it,&#8221; murmured
Cora. &#8220;Perhaps I can help&mdash;I have friends&mdash;Jack
and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes the train!&#8221; interrupted Jack.
&#8220;Come on, Cora!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see you again, Freda,&#8221; said Cora,
hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look for you on the train. I&#8217;ve
got to get my party together. Don&#8217;t forget&mdash;I&#8217;ll
see you again!&#8221; and, wondering what was the cause
of her friend&#8217;s worry, Cora hastened up the platform,
toward her companions, while the train
steamed noisily in.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>FREDA&#8217;S STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, are we all here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Count noses!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody lose anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a pocketbook it&#8217;s mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially if it has money in it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus the motor girls, and their boy friends,
sent merry quip and jest back and forth as they
found seats in the coach, and settled down for the
trip to Crystal Bay. Cora, after making sure that
the girls had comfortable seats, and noting that
Jack had pre-empted the place beside Marita,
leaned over Bess and whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back in the next car for a little
while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you lose anything?&#8221; asked Belle, who
overheard what Cora said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you saw me talking to that girl on the
platform; didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I wondered who she was,&#8221; remarked
Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was Freda Lewis.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Freda Lewis! Why, I never would have
known her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I!&#8221; added Belle. &#8220;How she has
changed! Of course you were more intimate
with her than we were, Cora; but she certainly
doesn&#8217;t seem to be the same girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Cora. &#8220;She and her
mother are in trouble&mdash;financial trouble. I&#8217;m
going back and talk to her. I want to help her if
I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while Cora is thus bent on her errand of
good cheer, it may not be out of place, for the
benefit of my new readers, to tell a little something
more about the characters of this story, and
how they figured in the preceding books of this
series.
</p>
<p>To begin with the motor girls, there were three
of them, though friends and guests added to the
number at times. Somehow, in speaking of the
motor girls, I always think of Cora Kimball first.
Perhaps it is because she was rather of a commanding
type. She was a splendid girl, tall and dark.
Her mother was a wealthy widow, who for some
years had made her home in the quiet New England
town of Chelton, where she owned valuable
property. And, while I am at it, I might mention
that Jack was Cora&#8217;s only brother, the three forming
the Kimball household.
</p>
<p>Bess and Belle Robinson were twins, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Perry Robinson. Mr.
Robinson was a wealthy railroad man, associated
with large metropolitan interests.
</p>
<p>Bess, Belle and Cora had been chums since their
motoring days began, when Cora had been given
a car, and, after some persuasion, Mr. Robinson
also had bought one for his daughters.
</p>
<p>I think I have already intimated that Bess was
plump and rosy&mdash;a little too plump, she herself admitted
at times. Her sister was just the opposite&mdash;tall
and willowy, so that the two formed quite
a contrast.
</p>
<p>Marita Osborne was a newcomer in Chelton,
who had soon won her way into the hearts of the
motor girls, so much so that Cora had invited her
to come to the bungalow at Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>Each year Cora and her chums sought some
new form of Summer vacation pleasure, and this
time they had decided on the seashore, in a quiet
rather old-fashioned resort, which the girls, on a
preliminary inspection trip, had voted most charming.
In fact they went into such raptures over it
that Jack and his chums had decided to go there
also. So the boys and girls would be together.
</p>
<p>Speaking of the boys, the two who will come in
for the most consideration will be Walter Pennington
and Ed Foster. Walter was perhaps a closer
chum of Jack&#8217;s than was Ed, the former attending
Exmouth College with Jack, where, of late, Ed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
had taken a post-graduate course. Ed was considered
quite a sportsman, and was fond of hunting
and fishing.
</p>
<p>The first book of this series, entitled &#8220;The
Motor Girls,&#8221; tells how Cora became possessed of
her car, the <i>Whirlwind</i>, and what happened after
she got it. In that powerful machine she and her
girls chums unraveled a mystery of the road in a
manner satisfactory to themselves and many
others.
</p>
<p>When the motor girls went on a tour, they made
a strange promise&mdash;or rather Cora did&mdash;and
how she kept it you will find fully set forth in the
second volume. In the third you may read of the
doings of the girls at Lookout Beach, where came
two runaways whom Cora befriended. The runaways
were two girls&mdash;but there, I must not spoil
the story for you by telling you their secret.
</p>
<p>Going through New England in their cars, the
motor girls had a strange experience with the gypsies,
as set forth in the fourth volume. Cora was
in dire straits for a time, but with her usual good
luck, and her good sense, she finally turned the
situation to the advantage of herself and her
chums.
</p>
<p>Motoring so appealed to the girls that when
they got the chance to change from the land to the
water they eagerly took it. Cora became the owner
of a fine motor boat, and in the story &#8220;The Motor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Girls on Cedar Lake,&#8221; you may read of what she
and her friends did with their craft. The hermit
of Fern Island had much to be thankful for, after
meeting Cora, who did him a great service.
</p>
<p>Longing for wider waters in which to display
their skill as amateur motor-boatists, the girls
went to the coast the Summer following their experiences
on Cedar Lake, and there they found
the waif from the sea. Again did Cora and her
chums take advantage of an opportunity to befriend
an unfortunate.
</p>
<p>The experiences of that Summer were talked of
nearly all of the following Winter. Now warm
weather had come again, and with it the desire to
be flitting to a watering place. Crystal Bay, as I
have said, was selected, and of the start for that
place I have already told.
</p>
<p>Cora, walking back through the coaches, looking
from side to side for Freda, found herself
wondering what had caused the sudden change
in her former companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was considered well-off at school,&#8221; murmured
Cora, as she saw her friend half way down
the second coach, &#8220;but she never appeared fond
of money. Now the loss of it seems to have
changed her terribly. I wonder if it can be&mdash;just
money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora reached the seat where Freda was, with
her face turned toward the window.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am here, you see,&#8221; announced Cora,
pleasantly. &#8220;I left them to shift for themselves a
while. They do seem to depend so much on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you are always doing things
for others,&#8221; said Freda, and there was a suspicious
brightness in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I hope I can do something for you!&#8221;
exclaimed Cora, earnestly. &#8220;Come, Freda, dear,
tell me your troubles&mdash;that is, if you would like
to,&#8221; she added quickly, not wishing to force a confidence
for which the other might not be ready.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cora, dear, of course you know I want
to&mdash;it isn&#8217;t that! Only I don&#8217;t like to pile my
worries on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on&mdash;it always helps to tell someone else.
Who knows but what I may help you. Is it a real
worry, Freda?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So real that sometimes I am afraid to think
about it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the girl&#8217;s fear. She
looked over her shoulder as though she expected
to see some unpleasant object, or person.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you begin at the beginning,&#8221; suggested
Cora, with a smile. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll know what
we are talking of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the beginning was,&#8221; said
Freda slowly, &#8220;but I can almost see the&mdash;ending,&#8221;
and she seemed to shiver. &#8220;But where are you
going, Cora, you and your friends?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
&#8220;I must not be selfish and talk only about myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to Crystal Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Crystal Bay! How odd, just where mother
is, and where I am going. Then I shall see you
often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; murmured Cora. &#8220;We have a
cute little bungalow, and the boys&mdash;my brother
and his chums&mdash;will use a tent. But I want to
hear more about your trouble. Really, Freda, you
do look quite ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps that is partly because I have been
traveling all night. It is always so wearying. But
my chief cause of anxiety is for mother. She is
really on the verge of a breakdown, the doctor
says. Oh, if anything happens to her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; urged Cora. &#8220;Perhaps it
will help you if you tell me some particulars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Freda, bravely. &#8220;It is this way.
My grandfather was a pioneer land-owner of a
large tract at Crystal Bay. It came to us, after
papa died, and we lived well on the income from
it, for there was much farm land besides the big
house we lived in. But a month or so ago a big
land company, that wants to get our property for
a factory site, filed a claim against us, saying we
had no good title to the estate. They said certain
deeds had not been filed, and that we were only
trespassers, and must get off.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And did you go?&#8221; asked Cora, with deep interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but I am afraid we&#8217;ll have to. You
see these men took the matter to court. They got
an injunction, I think it is called. Anyhow, it was
some document that forbade the people who rent
the land from us from paying us any more money
until the case was settled. And, as we depend on
the rents for our living&mdash;well, you see we haven&#8217;t
any living now, to speak of,&#8221; and Freda tried to
smile through her tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; cried Cora, impulsively.
&#8220;And can nothing be done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have tried, mother and I. But we really
have no money to hire lawyers, and neither have
any of what few friends and relations there are
left. I have just been on a quest of that kind, but
it was not successful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are supposed to be some documents&mdash;deeds,
mortgages, or something like that, in existence,
and if we could only get hold of them we
might prove our claim, and force the men to let
us have our rent money again. But until we get
those papers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda paused suggestively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I could think of a way to help
you!&#8221; murmured Cora. &#8220;I can see you have been
suffering!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind so much about myself,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Freda, bravely, &#8220;but I am really more worried
about mother than I am about the property. If
worst came to worst I could go to work, but
mother has taken so to heart the actions of the
land sharks! She never was strong, you know.
You met her; did you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not, but perhaps I may have done so.
Now, Freda, I am going to help you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora spoke enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you? How?&#8221; asked the other, eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just know how, but I am. First I&#8217;m
going to think this over, and then I&#8217;m going to talk
about it with Jack. He has a friend&mdash;Ed Foster&mdash;who
knows something about law. We may be
able to get ahead of these land sharks yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so!&#8221; gasped Freda, with a fond
look at Cora. &#8220;It is so good of you to bother
with poor me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; asked Cora. &#8220;You
look as though you needed bothering with. Take
care that you don&#8217;t break down, too, Freda.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall keep up. I must, for mother&#8217;s sake.
Oh, but those men were positively brutal when
they told her she had no right to grandfather&#8217;s
property! But it has done me good to talk to
you, Cora dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad of it. You look better already.
Now wouldn&#8217;t you like to come forward and meet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
some of the girls? You know the Robinson twins,
anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know them. But I don&#8217;t want to see
anyone just yet. Later on, perhaps. I just want
to rest, and think. It was awfully good of you to
come to me. We shall see each other at Crystal
Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed we shall. Well, then, if you won&#8217;t
come I&#8217;ll go back to my friends. Now don&#8217;t forget&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to help you, Freda!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so good of you! I feel more hope
and courage now. I&mdash;I feel like&mdash;fighting those
land sharks!&#8221; and Freda clenched her little hands
as though the struggle to come would be a physical
one.
</p>
<p>With a reassuring pat on Freda&#8217;s shoulder
Cora left her friend, to go to her chums in the
other coach. She found them about to organize
a searching party to look for her, and they clamored
for the reason for her desertion.
</p>
<p>She told them something of Freda&#8217;s story, and
Ed Foster promised to talk the matter over with
Mrs. Lewis later, and see if he could give any legal
aid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;There ought
to be a law to punish such men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There probably are laws,&#8221; said Cora, &#8220;but
the trouble is there are so many laws that bad men
can often use them for their own ends.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Portia. A Daniel come to judgment!&#8221;
cried Ed. &#8220;With you on her side, Freda is sure
to win!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But, though the motor girls tried to be merry,
the little cloud of Freda&#8217;s trouble overshadowed
them all the way to Crystal Bay.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>CRYSTAL BAY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the bungalow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me for that motor boat of Cora&#8217;s!&#8221; cried
Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed his sister. &#8220;Not
till I try her first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had alighted at the station, and there was
the confusion that always follows engaging a carriage
and seeing that the baggage has safely
arrived. Cora found time to slip off for a minute
and whisper words of cheer to Freda. Then she
rejoined her chums, and made ready for the trip
to the bungalow.
</p>
<p>The boys, with a fine disregard of housekeeping
responsibilities, were already making plans to go
fishing that afternoon, having spied a man who
took out parties in his launch.
</p>
<p>But finally order came out of chaos. The girls
found themselves at their bungalow, surrounded
by their belongings. The boys, after seeing that
their possessions were piled in the tent, slipped on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
their oldest garments and began overhauling their
fishing tackle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to do anything toward getting
a meal?&#8221; asked Cora of Jack, as she went
over to the tent to borrow a corkscrew with which
to open some olives.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought maybe you&#8217;d ask us over,&#8221; he
answered, craftily, as he adjusted a reel on his
rod.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jack!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;We can&#8217;t! We&#8217;ve
got so much to unpack. Besides, we&#8217;re only going
to have a light lunch now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>light</i> lunch! Excuse me. I know&mdash;crackers,
pickles and olives. Never! We&#8217;ll go to the town
delicatessen, sister mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness there is one,&#8221; murmured
Cora.
</p>
<p>She hastened back to the bungalow. And then
began a series of strenuous happenings.
</p>
<p>Somehow trunks and suitcases were unpacked;
somehow rooms were picked out, rejected, taken
again, and finally settled on. Then, between the
nibblings at the crackers and pickles Jack had despised,
the girls settled down, and at last had
time to admire the place they had selected for their
Summer stay.
</p>
<p>A woman had been engaged to open the bungalow
for them, and she had provided most of the
necessaries of life, aside from those the girls
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
brought with them. Cora and her chums had been
satisfied to have her attend to everything from
buying food to providing an oil stove on which
to cook it.
</p>
<p>There were a number of conveniences at Crystal
Bay. Stores were not out of reach, and supplies
could be procured with little trouble. A trip
across the bay brought one to the shores of a real
village, with school house, post-office and other
accessories of civilization. A trip down the bay
opened into eel pots in August, bluefishing in
September and deep sea fishing later on, when the
Summer colonists had departed.
</p>
<p>Very early in the morning after the arrival of
the motor girls at Crystal Bay, house, tent and
bungalow were deserted&mdash;it was all a matter of
motor boat. Moored to the brand new dock, at
Tangle Turn, a brand new motor craft heaved
with the incoming waves and tugged at its ropes
whenever a sufficiently strong motion of the water
gave it excuse to attempt an escape.
</p>
<p>This was the <i>Chelton</i>, the &#8220;up-to-datest&#8221; little-big
motor boat possible to own or acquire, according
to the verdict of the young men from Chelton
who had just now passed judgment, and the wise
decision of Cora and her girl friends who had
actually bought the boat, after having taken a
post-graduate course in catalogs and hardware
periodicals, to say nothing of the countless interviews
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
they had found it necessary to hold with
salesmen and yacht agents.
</p>
<p>They were all there, even Freda, who declared
she ought to be busy with other matters, but that
the call of the colony was too strong for her that
one morning, at least.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we know how to run her,&#8221; insisted
Cora to Ed, the latter having expressed doubt as
to the girls&#8217; ability to manage so important a craft.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t we run the <i>Pet</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, but this&mdash;this is a deep-sea boat,&#8221; Ed
explained, &#8220;and you might run yourselves away to
other shores.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And land on a desert island? What sport!&#8221;
exclaimed Lottie, to whom motor boating was an
entirely new experience. &#8220;I hope we make it
Holland. I have always longed to see a real, live
Holland boy. The kind who are all clothes and
wooden shoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might make one up for you,&#8221; suggested
Belle. &#8220;I think Wallie would look too cute for
anything in skirty trousers and polonaise shirts.
Just let his locks grow a little&mdash;Look out there,
Bess! That&#8217;s water around the boat. It only
looks like an oil painting. It&#8217;s real&mdash;wet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bess was climbing over the dock edge, and of
course the boys could not allow her that much
exercise without pretending that she was in danger
of going overboard. After Belle unhooked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the hem of her sister&#8217;s skirt from an iron bolt,
thereby giving Bess a sudden drop to the deck of
the <i>Chelton</i>, however, Bess declared she knew
water when she saw it, and also the difference between
a water color and an oil painting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you call her <i>Chelton</i> for?&#8221; asked
Walter. &#8220;I thought you decided to take the
name from the first remark the first stranger
should make about her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and what do you think that was?&#8221;
laughed Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Push&#8217;!&#8221; promptly answered Freda. &#8220;An old
fisherman came along as Jack was arranging the
painter, and he just said &#8216;push&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a handy little name,&#8221; commented
Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next some boys, out clamming, saw her,&#8221;
said Jack, &#8220;and they said &#8216;peach.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Either of which would have done nicely,&#8221; declared
Ed. &#8220;Peach would have been the very
name&mdash;after the girls&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Chelton</i> is dignified and appropriate,&#8221; interposed
Cora; &#8220;besides, if we should stray off to
Holland they would know along the Dikes that
we belonged in Chelton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t forget that the wheel is a sea
wheel and turns opposite to the direction you want
to go,&#8221; cautioned Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; inquired Lottie, who had
joined the other in examining the boat.
</p>
<p>She was shown with patience. The boys were
plainly glad that one of the girls, at least, did not
know all about running a motor boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And oh, what is that?&#8221; gasped Marita.
&#8220;That cunning little playhouse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Playhouse!&#8221; repeated Cora. &#8220;That&#8217;s our
living room&mdash;our cabin. Those fixtures are to
cook with, eat with, live with and do all our housekeeping
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Also die with,&#8221; added Walter. &#8220;I think that
electric toaster might be all right for fudge, but
for real bread&mdash;Now say, Cora, can you really
cook pork and beans on that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the very latest, most improved and
most expensive electric attachments on the market,&#8221;
answered Cora, with a show of dignity, &#8220;and
when you boys take a meal here, if we ever invite
you to, I think we can easily prove the advantage
of electrical attachments over campfire iron pots.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cooking apparatus was examined with interest.
A motor boat cabin fitted up with such a
&#8220;kitchenette&#8221; was indeed a novelty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; explained Cora, &#8220;we have two ways
of getting power. We can take it from the storage
battery, or from the little dynamo attached to
the motor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie, to whom a &#8220;current&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
meant little, but who wanted to seem interested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is to provide for the various kinds of
cooking,&#8221; Jack said, jokingly. &#8220;Now eggs are
weak, they cook by storage; but a Welsh rabbit is
done by the dynamo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means something else,&#8221; Captain Cora remarked,
&#8220;namely, if we have company for supper,
and the storage current gives out, we will not have
to make it a progressive meal, extending into the
next day. The course can be continued from the
extra current.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of Malachi!&#8221; exclaimed Walter.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our boiler,&#8221; said Bess, who knew something
about the boat&#8217;s fitting up. &#8220;We have that for
dishwater.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dishwater!&#8221; repeated Ed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got this
down to domestic science all right. That rubber
hose runs off the hot water from the cylinder jacket,
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;They will be making
tea with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it salty?&#8221; innocently asked Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely,&#8221; said Belle, for the girls had all taken
an interest in the housework-made-easy-plan, and
had arranged to use the boiling water as it came
from the motor after cooling the cylinder. &#8220;But
it won&#8217;t hurt dishes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now I call that neat,&#8221; commented Ed, &#8220;and
to think that mere girls should have thought of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda gave Cora a meaning glance. &#8220;Girls
ought to think of the housework,&#8221; she laughed
with a wink at Belle. &#8220;Just look at the linen
chest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened a small box and exhibited a goodly
supply of suitable linen. No table cloths; just
small pieces, doilies and plenty of neat, pretty
towels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s board here,&#8221; suggested Walter. &#8220;Our
food was really rude this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we go out for a sail?&#8221; asked Ed, attempting
to turn on the gasoline.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no indeed!&#8221; Cora answered quickly.
&#8220;Not a box is unpacked in our place yet, and perhaps,
if you boys are all to rights, you wouldn&#8217;t
mind giving us a hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course we&#8217;re all to rights,&#8221; replied
Jack. &#8220;I had a bolt of mosquito netting for my
blanket last night and Wallie&#8217;s bathrobe for my
pillow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I made friends with a pretty, little, soft
ground mole, Jack,&#8221; put in Ed, &#8220;and if the rest
of our boxes do not arrive and unpack themselves
in time for your slumber this eve, that mole has
agreed to cuddle up under your left ear. I believe
you sleep on your left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; Jack said, &#8220;but I see no reason why
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
mere household truck should keep us from a cruise.
I am aching to try the <i>Chelton</i>, Cora.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and Freda were talking in whispers in the
other end of the boat. It was no &#8220;mere household
truck&#8221; surely that brought the serious expression
to their faces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t far,&#8221; Freda was heard to say, &#8220;and
he promised to wait for us this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I do want to be with you,&#8221; Cora answered.
&#8220;But I won&#8217;t let them take the boat out the first
time without me. It cost too much to run the risk
of damaging it by sky-larking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what are you two up to?&#8221; demanded
Jack. &#8220;Just because Drayton Ward has not arrived,
we are held up for his coming. I tell you,
Sis, that chap may not put in an appearance at all,
here. He knows&mdash;sweller places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you mind him, Cora,&#8221; Ed interrupted.
&#8220;Dray is sure to come. He had his canoe
shipped two days ago, besides sending to the cove
for his motor boat. I expect some tall times when
he gets here. Our own innocent little <i>Lassie</i> won&#8217;t
know how to skip over the waves at all&mdash;she&#8217;ll be
that flustered when the swell, gold-railed, mahogany-bound,
carpet-floored <i>Dixie</i> gets here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take more than a mere <i>Dixie</i> to
knock out our <i>Lassie</i>,&#8221; declared Walter, &#8220;but I
should like to know why she is not on the scene
yet. Didn&#8217;t we plainly say Tuesday?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We did, plainly and emphatically. But a
boat builder, letter or seller has a right to make
his own day in delivering the goods. We&#8217;ll be
lucky if we get the barge at all without taking the
sheriff up to that shipyard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile we have the <i>Chelton</i>,&#8221; said Ed,
tugging at Cora&#8217;s sleeve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we must get back to the bungalow,&#8221; she
observed. &#8220;Freda and I have an important appointment
for eleven, and if you all promise not
to follow us or attempt to go out in the <i>Chelton</i>,
perhaps we will have some interesting news for
you this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys strolled away, talking about the motor
boat they had hired. Money, for some reason,
was not plentiful that Summer with Jack and his
chums, and they had to be content with a second-hand
craft, that had been patched and re-patched
until there was little of the original left. They
were not even sure the <i>Lassie</i> would run, but they
were anxious to try her.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE RED OAR</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This way, Cora. The sand is so heavy out
there it is better to keep near the edge,&#8221; said
Freda, as the two girls tramped along in the deep
sand of the seashore that banded Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it perfectly beautiful along here?&#8221;
exclaimed Cora, in rapt delight. &#8220;I had no idea
the little place could be so charming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; returned Freda, with a suspicion of
a sigh. &#8220;Over there, just in that splendid green
stretch is, or was, grandfather&#8217;s place. It runs
all along to the island, and on the other side there
is a stream that has been used for a mill race.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there!&#8221; Cora repeated. &#8220;Why, that
looks like the very best part of the bay. And
that house on the hill?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather&#8217;s own home and&mdash;mother&#8217;s,&#8221;
finished Freda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it rented now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have rented it for three years, and it
has brought us quite a little income,&#8221; said Freda.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you see that is cut off now. I am sure I do
not know who collects the rents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a shame!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;And all because
there is some technical proof of ownership
missing. I should think that when your family
had undisputed possession for years it ought to be
sufficient to establish your rights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we never dreamed we could lose it,&#8221;
Freda explained. &#8220;Mother and I have lived
there in the Winter since father died, and we have
rented it in Summer, as I said. Of course the
Summer is the desirable time here. And we had
some of the loveliest old furniture. But when we
had to break up we sold most of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out! There&#8217;s a hole there,&#8221; Cora
warned just in time, for in the heavy sand little
rivulets were creeping from some rollers tossed in
by a passing boat. The bay was dotted with many
craft, and the picture it presented gave Cora keen
delight, for it forecasted a merry Summer for the
motor girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We only have a little farther to go,&#8221; Freda
said. &#8220;I hope old Denny has kept his word and
stayed in. He is the queerest old fellow&mdash;you will
be amused at him, I am sure. But he was always
such a staunch friend of grandfather.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am anxious to meet him,&#8221; rejoined Cora.
&#8220;Somehow I feel we girls ought to get at the bottom
of this. Wouldn&#8217;t it be fine if we could?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;More than fine, it would be glorious!&#8221; Freda
replied. &#8220;If we lose it all now, I will have to look
for work. Not that I mind that,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but
I intend to take a course in nursing. I have always
longed to be a nurse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that would be a splendid profession for
you,&#8221; Cora agreed. &#8220;I do hope you will not have
to go to work in some office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Denny! Denny!&#8221; called Freda,
leaving Cora without further ceremony, and hurrying
ahead as fast as the soft sand would allow.
&#8220;See, there he is! Just going out in his fishing
boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora ran after her, and soon they overtook the
old fisherman, who was deaf. Freda didn&#8217;t mind
getting her shoes wet in order to approach the
water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Denny,&#8221; she called, &#8220;come in
here. We want to talk to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took his pipe from his mouth, in order that
his mind should not be distracted. Then he pushed
his cap back, and dropped an oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Freddie, is that you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Sure I
thought you was comin&#8217; up to the shack, and I&#8217;ve
bin waitin&#8217; for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on our way up there now. You are
not going out, are you?&#8221; pleaded Freda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Freddie,&#8221; (he always called her Freddie),
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come right in. I was only goin&#8217; acrost to
get a few little things; but they can wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora now had a chance to see this quaint old
fellow. He was Irish, with many fine humorous
wrinkles about his eyes and mouth. He seemed to
breathe through his pipe, so constantly did he inhale
it, and just how he kept his sailor&#8217;s blouse so
clean, and his worn clothes so neat, was a trick he
had learned in his younger days in the navy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a fine day?&#8221; he commented, with a
nod to Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply perfect,&#8221; she answered, seeing there
was no need for a formal introduction. &#8220;I have
been telling Freda how surprised I was at the
beauty of this place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surprised, is it? Sure, there ain&#8217;t another spot
this side of Cape Cod with as many fine points to
it. I wouldn&#8217;t leave this little bay for a berth on
any ocean liner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend, Cora Kimball, is from Chelton,
Uncle Denny. Do you know where that is?&#8221;
asked Freda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chelton? Chelton? Sure, I do. I went
through there once in a parade wagon. We were
out with the G. A. R. and I guess the parade got
lost, for I remember at Chelton we had to put up
for the night in an old church they were using for
a fire house. But we had a fine time,&#8221; and he
chuckled at the recollection. &#8220;And next day we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
finished up without the need of a wagon. It was
like camp days to scatter ourselves about the big
ramshackle place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, that&#8217;s out in the East End,&#8221; Cora
said. &#8220;We have quite an up-to-date fire house in
Chelton Center.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that was good enough for me,&#8221; he asserted.
&#8220;But come along and I&#8217;ll show you my
shack. Freddie will be surprised at my new decorations.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Up the little board walk to a path through the
woods the three tramped. Denny Shane was popular
with young folks; even the mischievous boys
who would occasionally untie his boat before a
storm had no reason to fear his wrath, for such
pranks were quickly forgotten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the mother, Freddie?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;How&#8217;s she gettin&#8217; on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she worries a good deal,&#8221; the girl replied.
&#8220;But I keep telling her it must come right
in time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it will. The rascals that would do wrong
to a widder couldn&#8217;t prosper. &#8217;Taint lucky. But
they&#8217;re foxy. Did you hear anything new?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but not much that is substantial. My
friend and I want to see you to find out all that
you may know about it. Perhaps there is some
clue we have been overlooking, that you could give
us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re welcome to all I know. But here
we are. No need to unlock my door,&#8221; he said as
he saw Cora smile at his unceremonious entrance
to the shack. &#8220;Them that has nothin&#8217; has nothin&#8217;
to fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A surprising little place, indeed, the girls were
shown into. Neat and orderly, yet convenient and
practical, was Denny Shane&#8217;s home. There was a
stove and a mantel, a table, two chairs and a long
bench. Pieces of rag carpet indicated the most
favored spots&mdash;those to be lived on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Freddie,&#8221; began Denny, drawing
out two chairs, &#8220;what do you think of my housekeeping?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are just as comfortable and neat as
possible,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;But I notice one thing
has not lost its place&mdash;your red oar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;indeed!&#8221; he said almost solemnly.
&#8220;That oar will stay with me while Denny Shane
has eyes to see it. It has a story, Freddie, and I
often promised to tell it to you. This is as good
a time as another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his pipe down, brought a big chair up to
the window, opened a back door to allow the salt
air to sweep in; then, while Cora looked with
quickening interest at the old red oar, that hung
over the fireplace, Denny shook his head reflectively
and started with his story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That oar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;seems like a link between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
me and Leonard Lewis&mdash;your grandpa, Freddie.
And, too, it is a reminder of the night when I
nearly went over the other sea, and would have,
but for Leonard Lewis and his strong red oar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A light flashed into the old eyes. Plainly the
recollections brought up by his story were sacred.
He left his chair and went over to the mantel,
climbed up on a box and touched the oar that had
sagged a little from its position.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind rocks this shanty so,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;the oar thinks it&#8217;s out on the waves again, I
guess. I don&#8217;t like to spoil it with nails or strings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks very artistic,&#8221; Cora declared; &#8220;but
how curious that an oar should be painted red.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there was only one pair of them, that I
know of. One went with the wreck, and this one
Len Lewis held on to. Now I&#8217;ll tell you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he seated himself and this time started
off briskly with the tale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a raw January night&mdash;in fact, it seemed
as if it had been night all day for all the chance the
sun had to get out. A howling wind whistled and
fairly shrieked at everything that didn&#8217;t fly fast
enough to suit it. Len and me had been puttin&#8217;
in a lot of time together at his house, just chinnin&#8217;&mdash;there
wasn&#8217;t much else to do but to keep warm.
Well, along about five o&#8217;clock, we heard a rocket!
The wind died away for a minute or so, and we
dashed out to the beach to get the lay of that distress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
signal. Talk about big city fires!&#8221; he
digressed. &#8220;A fire on land ain&#8217;t what it is on sea.
It always seems like as if death has a double
power with the fire and the deep and nothing but
the sky above to fan the flame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We soon saw the smoke. It was from a point
just over the turn, where the clouds dip down and
touch the waves. A little tail of smoke crawled up
and hung black and dirty, not gettin&#8217; any bigger
nor spreadin&#8217; much. When we sighted her, we
went to work in the way men of the sea have of
working together and never sayin&#8217; a word. Up
the beach we chased, and dragged out the boat we
called our &#8216;Lifer.&#8217; It was a good, strong fishin&#8217;
boat, and we kept her ready in the rough weather.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait!&#8217; yelled Len to me, just as I was pushin&#8217;
off. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a lucky pair of oars. They&#8217;re
bigger and heavier than ours, and I&#8217;ll toss &#8217;em in.
We might need &#8217;em.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little I thought of the need we would have!
And I always laughed at Len&#8217;s idea of luck&mdash;and
me an Irishman, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother always said grandfather was queer
about such things,&#8221; Freda remarked. &#8220;I remember
we had an old jug that he found on one of his
birthdays. He would never allow that jug to be
thrown out; he said it meant a jug full of good
luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it, of course, was an empty jug,&#8221; Cora
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
said, with a smile. &#8220;Perhaps that is, after all,
the luckiest kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Denny chuckled over that remark, and added
he had not much use for jugs of any kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; away from my yarn,&#8221; he said,
presently. &#8220;We took the big thick oars and
pulled out against the wind. By this time the hail
was comin&#8217; down in chunks that would cut the face
off you. Sometimes there are a lot of stragglers
around here, but when we need a man, of course,
there is not one in sight. But we rowed away and
somehow managed to get close to the wreck. It
was a little steamer, not much bigger than a tug,
and it was burning faster than the smoke told us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You throw the rope and I&#8217;ll stick to the
oars!&#8217; shouted Len, his voice sounding like a
wheeze in the wind. There were three men on
the steamer and they were just about tuckered out.
They were clingin&#8217; to the rail, their hands blisterin&#8217;
from the flames that were sweepin&#8217; up close to
them even as they touched the water&#8217;s edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful thing to see sufferin&#8217; like that,&#8221;
he put in. &#8220;I won&#8217;t ever forget how those fellows
tumbled into our boat. They just rolled in like
dead men. But my rope got caught in the rudder
of the steamer, and I tugged and tugged, but it
looked as if we would have to let her burn off
before we could free ourselves. Just when I decided
to make a big haul at it I came near my end.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
I stood up, gave the rope a yank, and with that&mdash;rip!
She let go! And I went with it over into
the water!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; Cora exclaimed. &#8220;It was bad
enough to have to rescue the other men, but for
you to go into that roaring ocean!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bad, Miss,&#8221; agreed the narrator. &#8220;And
the feel of that water as I struck it! It was like
a bath of sword-points. Well, that&#8217;s where the
oar comes in! Bless the bit of wood it was cut
from, it sure was a good, strong stick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I flopped into the water, like a fish
dumped out of a net, your grandpop, Freddie,
took nary a chance at reachin&#8217; me with the rope.
He dropped the regular oars and took one of the
pair he called lucky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here,&#8217; he yelled, &#8216;grab to that!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see the red flash now as it nearly hit
me on the head, but though I did make a stab at
it the water was that cold and the ice so thick on
me hands that I couldn&#8217;t hold on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty bad to be floppin&#8217; around like that,
I can tell you. But Len kept shoutin&#8217; and when
one of the other fellows got enough breath to
stand up with, he took a hand at the rescuin&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was him who dropped the mate to that oar
overboard. Mad! I could hear Len yell through
the thick of it all. But he held the last red oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With the effort to keep up me blood heated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
some, and the next time I saw the flash of red I
grabbed it good an&#8217; proper. It took three of
them to haul me up, but I clung to the red oar and
that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m here this minute. Likewise, it&#8217;s
why the oar is here with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a long pause. The girls had been
thrilled with the simple recital, so void of anything
like conceit in the part that Denny himself had
played in the work of rescue.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TWO MEN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And the red oar won out,&#8221; Cora remarked,
looking at the old relic with something akin to
reverence. &#8220;Perhaps, after all, there is something
in luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked like it,&#8221; agreed Denny. &#8220;And after
we got back Len couldn&#8217;t pay any attention to
the half-frozen men, or to me, that had been
pretty well chilled&mdash;all he could do was talk about
the luck of that oar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; Freda put in. &#8220;Your
rope had nearly burned, your light oar broke, one
of the heavy pair went overboard and this one did
most of the work getting back, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Denny, &#8220;for while we had
another pair to work with, they were slim, and
weak, but that fellow, it sure was tough then; but
lately when I take it down it seems to have shrunk,
for it&#8217;s gettin&#8217; lighter, somehow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did you come to get it?&#8221; asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of my story,&#8221; said Denny.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
&#8220;When Len was taken very sick, of course I used
to stay with me friend as much as I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda unconsciously pushed her chair nearer
the old man. Surely to hear of the last days of
her good grandfather&#8217;s life was a matter too important
to pass over lightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father was livin&#8217; then, Freddie,&#8221; Denny
went on, &#8220;and a fine healthy young man, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father died so suddenly,&#8221; said Freda,
&#8220;mother hardly ever speaks of his death. She
always seems overcome after talking of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a sad thing,&#8221; Denny digressed.
&#8220;To go off in the morning, a-whistlin&#8217; and happy,
and to be brought home without a word in him.
Freddie, dear, I oughtn&#8217;t to talk of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda brushed aside a tear. Her father&#8217;s
death had been caused by apoplexy, when she was
but a mite of a child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the queer part of it was that your grandfather
seemed to think I would outlive his son,
and John such a strappin&#8217;-lookin&#8217; fellow,&#8221; resumed
Denny. &#8220;Len called me to him, and him sick and
miserable, and he says: &#8216;Denny, John&#8217;s not as
strong as he looks, and I want you to do all you
can to help Louisa,&#8217; (your mother of course,
Freddie), &#8216;for she has the child to raise,&#8217; he said.
Well, he wouldn&#8217;t let me interrupt him when I
tried to speak of John. He would have it that I
should keep an eye to things. Your grandfather
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Lewis left me no papers, however&mdash;I supposed
John had them&mdash;but he left me the old red oar.
He had fairly been playin&#8217; with it for years, always
polishin&#8217; it or shapin&#8217; it off here or there. I often
look at the marks of his knife on it, and wonder
why he seemed fond of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; said Freda, earnestly, &#8220;you have
kept your promise, Uncle Denny. Mother often
speaks of how good you were when I was small.
Father never had any papers about grandfather&#8217;s
land; all he had related to family keepsakes. The
strange part of it all is to me that a man of
grandfather&#8217;s intelligence should be so remiss
about his property claims.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Freddie, you don&#8217;t understand. There
seemed no need for deeds and mortgage papers
then about here. Everybody knew everyone else,
and things seemed to be solid forever. But now
them plagued land fellows&mdash;well, they&#8217;ve got a
good cheek, is all I can say.&#8221; And he emptied
an unsmoked pipe of tobacco in his indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are going to get after them,&#8221; Cora
declared. &#8220;We want to go slowly, and, if possible,
find out what their intentions are. Find
what sort of company they claim to have, in the
first place, and if they are an honorable set of men
they ought to make open claims, instead of sneaking
around, and trying to find out things that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
might cause a flaw in the title. I am suspicious,
for one,&#8221; she finished significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good luck to your spunk,&#8221; said Denny,
&#8220;and I never knew the like of it to fail. But say,
tell me about the boat. What did the lads think
of the fixin&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was the greatest fun,&#8221; Freda replied.
&#8220;They could not imagine how we ever thought of
using the cylinder water for a dishwater supply.
I never gave it away that you suggested it to
Cora&#8217;s mechanic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to thank you, Mr. Shane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Shane!&#8221; Denny interrupted. &#8220;Say, if you
call me that I&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m reading me own death
notice in the <i>Beacon</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora laughed at this, and agreed he should be
&#8220;Uncle Denny&#8221; to her as well as to the others
of the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was splendid of you to have the boat
all ready for us when we came. I did not suppose
Freda had a chance to get down to it before we
loomed up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the risin&#8217; hour for us folks
at the Bay,&#8221; returned Denny, with a sly wink.
&#8220;Freddie couldn&#8217;t stay abed when the sun is beckonin&#8217;
on the waves; could you, Freddie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the early Summer mornings are beautiful,&#8221;
replied Freda, &#8220;and I am sorry I had to lose
so many of them. Who&#8217;s that? The girls, looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
for us! There&#8217;s Bess puffing, and Belle&mdash;fluffing.
I do think they are the most attractive
pair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora smiled, for her own devotion to the Robinson
twins was only paralleled by the twins&#8217; devotion
to Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora! Freda!&#8221; called youthful voices from
the path. &#8220;Where are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in&mdash;do!&#8221; answered Denny, who always
had a spare chair for visitors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we can&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Belle. &#8220;Cora, the boys
are threatening to take out the <i>Chelton</i>. And oh!
I&#8217;m completely out of breath. It&#8217;s dreadful to try
to hurry through the sand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed they shall not take the <i>Chelton</i> out
without my permission,&#8221; Cora declared. &#8220;When
we make our initial trip I intend to command it.
For one thing, Uncle Denny is to come along; for
another&mdash;well, that&#8217;s to be a little surprise. This
afternoon at two exactly&mdash;will you come, Uncle
Denny?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will that,&#8221; the old sailor replied. &#8220;I think
it would be a good thing to have a little weight,
like my old head, in her when she starts out. Them
laddies are always up to pranks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we are just crazy to get out on the water,&#8221;
Bess put in, &#8220;and what do you think? That vain
little Lottie went all the way to town to get the
exact nautical cap. I wonder if she thinks folks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
in motor boats run slowly enough to see little
white caps on little light girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we get going I think all that will be
seen will be splash, and all that will be heard will
be chug,&#8221; Cora remarked. &#8220;But come on. Let&#8217;s
hurry along. I promised Rita to help her with
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Bess, curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Bessie, that would be telling,&#8221; replied
Cora, stopping just long enough to empty the sand
from her tennis shoe. Denny was trudging along
after them&mdash;he could not resist an excuse to go
down to the shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll say good-bye,&#8221; said Freda. &#8220;I have
to run back to mother. She will think I am lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are coming this afternoon?&#8221; Cora
insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I really can&#8217;t, Cora, thank you,&#8221; answered
the other. &#8220;I have something so important to
look after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you girls up to?&#8221; demanded Belle.
&#8220;You have been acting mysteriously ever since you
met on the train. Freda, it is really unpardonable
not to take the initial trip with us, but if you really
cannot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really cannot,&#8221; returned Freda, decisively,
and somehow the girls realized that Freda&#8217;s business
was urgent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll show you a short cut,&#8221; said Denny.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
&#8220;Take that path there&mdash;don&#8217;t be afraid of the
sign that the owner put up&mdash;he has no right to
the beach front; then when you get to the Lonely
Willow&mdash;do you know where that is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not one of them knew, but they were anxious to
find out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t miss the Lonely Willow, for it
stands all alone and looks as forlorn as the mast
of a sunken steamer,&#8221; said Denny. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the
deep hollow by the watercress patch. Turn around
that tree to your left and you&#8217;ll see another path.
But wait a minute,&#8221; he broke off, &#8220;maybe it&#8217;s a
bit lonely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are enough of us to shout if we
see bears,&#8221; Cora laughed. &#8220;We have to hurry,
and we will be glad to explore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye then, and good luck. I&#8217;ll be
at the dock ahead of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he the quaintest old man?&#8221; asked Belle
as the little party hurried along. Then she added:
&#8220;You and Freda made quite a visit. We began
to think you were kidnapped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We did make a stay,&#8221; agreed Cora, &#8220;but
Denny is a very old friend of Freda&#8217;s family, and,
to tell you the truth, we could hardly break away
when he started in to tell sea-yarns. Ouch! The
mud is deep. I guess we must be near the Lonely
Willow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; exclaimed Belle, who was somewhat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
in advance of the others. &#8220;Indeed, it does
stand all alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it scary here!&#8221; whispered Bess. &#8220;See
those two men under the Willow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All eyes were turned to the big tree. Two men
were seated on a branch that made a comfortable
seat. As the girls approached one of the men
wrapped some papers up and thrust them into his
pocket. But the movement was not lost on the
girls.
</p>
<p>No word was spoken for a few moments. Belle
dropped back a little as if to allow the others to
face the strangers first. Of course Cora, always
being the leader, boldly made her way along.
</p>
<p>They had to pass almost under the tree to reach
the path, but there was no halting once the girls
started out.
</p>
<p>Finally they had passed in perfect safety, but
as they were almost out of earshot one of the men
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought she&#8217;d be with him&mdash;that old
Denny!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the remark was lost, but this fragment
served to put Cora on her guard.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE &#8220;CHELTON&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it exciting?&#8221; cried Marita, who had
managed to have Jack help her over the dunes on
the way to the dock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right!&#8221; replied Jack, surveying her
&#8220;nautical&#8221; outfit. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t beat it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Silly! I mean going for the cruise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought you meant that rig you&#8217;re wearing.
It is most becoming, but I hope it won&#8217;t get
wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the water won&#8217;t hurt it. I got it on that
account. I think the girls&#8217; maroon sweaters look
dandy&mdash;they can be seen for such a distance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose togs have something to do with
a good time, although I must say Cora doesn&#8217;t
seem to give much time to hers. Look at Marita
in white. She looks like a French doll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is the cutest thing!&#8221; replied Lottie,
in her gushing way. &#8220;But Cora is simply stunning!
Just see how she stands out in the crowd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lottie and Jack strolled through the moss-padded
path that led to the white sands of Tangle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Turn, talking in this vein as they went. It was indeed
a merry crowd, and well worth noticing, as
was evinced by the number of curious spectators
already assembled on the dock to which the <i>Chelton</i>
was tied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the man?&#8221; asked Jack, espying a striking
figure in the throng.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Uncle Denny; don&#8217;t you know him?
He is the dearest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Lottie, I can see his bald head under
his cap at this distance without marine glasses, and
it&#8217;s a rule of the club that &#8216;dears&#8217; have special
advantages in the matter of healthy heads of hair.
But, of course, if you wish to call him &#8216;dear&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, you are the greatest tease,&#8221; she pouted.
</p>
<p>Bess, Belle and Cora had already reached the
motor boat. Denny was proudly &#8220;looking her
over,&#8221; pipe in mouth and hands in pockets. The
girls were bustling about, all enthusiasm, while the
boys, assuming an air of importance, found many
points to investigate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now take seats,&#8221; called Cora, &#8220;we are ready
to push off. Lottie, don&#8217;t lean overboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am watching the cutest little fish. See,
Bess,&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>Ed was on the dock with the rope loose from
the cleat. Cora was at the steering wheel, while
Denny insisted on turning the fly wheel, as that
seemed about the most difficult thing to do. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
gasoline was turned on, Jack attending to that, and
as Denny gave the fly wheel a vigorous turn, Ed
pushed off and jumped into the boat. The &#8220;push&#8221;
sent the <i>Chelton</i> out in the water, but the motor
failed to do its duty. Again Denny tried, but still
no response. As this is not unusual with any
motor, whether new or old, all hands waited
patiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s the <i>Dixie</i>!&#8221; called Lottie, jumping
up and waving to an approaching boat.
</p>
<p>At that instant the <i>Chelton</i> started with a jerk,
and there was a chorus of screams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lottie&#8217;s overboard!&#8221; cried the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Overboard!&#8221; repeated the boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; begged Cora. &#8220;She may sink!&#8221;
</p>
<p>To bring the boat to a sudden stop was not an
easy matter, and there were some moments of
suspense before the <i>Chelton</i> passed safely to the
other side of the spot where Lottie was struggling.
</p>
<p>The water was not so deep but that she was able
to scramble to her feet, but the wash of the boat
forced her to work violently to keep her head
above water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rope!&#8221; called Cora, who had dashed
from her position at the steering wheel to the side
of the boat where the mooring rope had been
dropped. In the excitement, of course, all crowded
to one side of the small craft, which caused it to
careen alarmingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There! There!&#8221; shouted Ed. &#8220;Lottie, grab
the rope!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; came the rather weak and shaky
reply. &#8220;I can&#8217;t reach it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By this time the <i>Dixie</i>, the innocent cause of the
accident, was alongside. Drayton Ward, the
wealthy young fellow who could boast of a motor
boat that would have aroused comment even at
Newport, leaned over the side and grasped the
arm of the girl in the water. The rest was a
simple matter, for soon Lottie was assisted over
the rail of the <i>Dixie</i>, and was in the finest boat on
Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; gasped Bess into
Cora&#8217;s ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clever!&#8221; replied Cora, simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the togs?&#8221; queried Jack, to whom the
accident had seemed something of a joke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity,&#8221; returned Belle, &#8220;and she did
look so sweet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>All this time the drenched girl was being most
carefully looked after by the gallant captain of the
<i>Dixie</i>. He was seeing to it that she did not suffer
from a chill, for a big coat had been wrapped
around her and her pretty white cap that had
merrily floated off was now replaced by one
marked &#8220;Dixie.&#8221; Altogether, for a mere Summer
dip, Lottie was having a magnificent time, as Ed
took pains to observe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t go with you now!&#8221; called Lottie.
&#8220;Mr. Ward has kindly offered to take me home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause after that remark. If Lottie
went back to the bungalow it seemed only reasonable
that someone should go with her. But who?
Everyone wanted to take the trip on the <i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us take you up to the point,&#8221; called Cora,
&#8220;and we can wait for you to change and come
back. Our trip would be spoiled with one of the
party missing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s shift,&#8221; suggested Drayton, with a
gracious smile at Cora. &#8220;Mine is probably the
faster boat. You get in here with us, Miss Cora,
and we will run up and down the bay while your
friends are working off the oil smoke. That&#8217;s a
neat little boat you have, a perfect little model,&#8221;
he finished, coming as close as possible to the
<i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours is all right, too, Dray,&#8221; replied Jack,
&#8220;but it looks too good to be true. Doesn&#8217;t shoot
up on land for a change, does it? I have heard
of <i>Dixies</i> doing that stunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie. &#8220;I am freezing
to death. I guess I&#8217;ll go change my dress.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; agreed Cora, who was ready to
leave her boat and go back to the bungalow with
Lottie. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; and she jumped to the dock
to which her boat had drifted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run along
with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nice way to treat a fellow,&#8221; complained Drayton.
&#8220;Well, fellows, I&#8217;ll race you while we are
waiting for the ladies to return. What do you
say, Jack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing, as long as Cora has finally condescended
to let me touch the wheel. Everybody
sit down this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without a word all hands, keen for a race as
soon as one was suggested, took seats, and the two
boats veered out into the bay and &#8220;lined up&#8221; for
the start. Denny was the proudest engineer
imaginable, and constantly looked over the fine
mechanism.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; shouted Ed, and at the word both
throttles were thrown wide open and the boats
shot up the bay, emitting clouds of smoke from
their newly oiled works, and &#8220;chugging&#8221; so rapidly
that the sounds were drowned in a roar. It was
a pretty sight, for in the girls&#8217; boat a line of
colored sweaters and waving caps lent life to the
gray of the waters, while Drayton, in his glistening,
highly-polished <i>Dixie</i>, only needed the glint
that the sun lent to complete the picture afforded
by his fine craft.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t this glorious!&#8221; exclaimed Marita.
&#8220;I thought I should be frightened, but this is&mdash;lovely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frightened!&#8221; repeated Belle. &#8220;I used to be
so afraid of the water I couldn&#8217;t see anything but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the bottom every time I came out; but now I just
love it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey there, Dray!&#8221; shouted Ed. &#8220;You&#8217;re out
of the course. Get in from shore!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s keeping his eye on those girls on the
beach,&#8221; laughed Walter. &#8220;Those are the lassies
who have the white canoe.&#8221; So saying he waved
his own cap and a flutter of handkerchiefs from
the beach came back in recognition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn at the island,&#8221; ordered Denny.
</p>
<p>Here a white flag fluttered, the stake left from
some recent sailing races. Gracefully the <i>Chelton</i>
rounded the stake first. Drayton had lost time in
running too close to shore. Only a minute later
the <i>Dixie</i> swayed after the <i>Chelton</i>, then the final
stretch was taken up in earnest. Spectators on the
bank might wave now, but the motorists had no
eyes for them. A slight miss in the <i>Chelton&#8217;s</i> explosion
brought Denny and Ed to their feet&mdash;there
should be no break in the rhythm of that chug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Ed called to the old sailor,
&#8220;only too much oil.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Denny shook his head lest a word might interfere
with the boat&#8217;s motion. Dray stood up
and did something that caused the bow of his boat
to shoot up, while the stern seemed to bury itself
in the waves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His is a racer,&#8221; Walter told Bess, who was as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
intent as any of the watchers on the result of the
trial of speed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe ours will turn out to be a winner,&#8221;
Bess responded. &#8220;We keep pretty close.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack never took his hand off the steering wheel,
Denny was watching the engine, and the others
were peering down the straight course ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m getting all wet,&#8221; exclaimed Marita,
for the spray was dashing in on all sides.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down in the bottom,&#8221; advised Walter,
&#8220;we can&#8217;t slacken up now. Or go in the cabin if
you like and close the ports.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was a signal for all three girls to slip down
to the floor of the boat and while they lost the
good view afforded from the seats, they evidently
enjoyed the change, and craned their necks to see
over the sides.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Dray will win,&#8221; complained Belle.
&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t expect to beat the <i>Dixie</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might,&#8221; encouraged Bess. &#8220;Cora said
this boat had remarkable speed for its size.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, whiz!&#8221; shouted Walter, &#8220;look at that
spray deluge Dray!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s missing,&#8221; added Ed, for the sounds
from the <i>Dixie</i> were distinctly out of time.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Dray&#8217;s boat slowed down, and the
<i>Chelton</i> shot so far ahead that it was plain something
had happened to the <i>Dixie</i>.
</p>
<p>Jack stood up and looked back. &#8220;Something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
is wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had better not get too
far ahead. Dray is fussing with the carbureter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The race was over. The girls stood up from
their hiding place and Jack turned the boat about.
By this time Dray had turned off the gasoline and
the <i>Dixie</i> merely heaved up and down on the
swells.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Dray?&#8221; called Walter.
&#8220;Something given way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Dray, &#8220;she simply
won&#8217;t &#8216;mote.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take a look at her,&#8221; suggested Denny,
ever eager for a new adventure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are Cora and Lottie!&#8221; exclaimed
Belle. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we go in for them, and look after
Dray&#8217;s boat afterward?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a nice way to treat a ship in
distress,&#8221; said Denny, &#8220;but excuse me,&#8221; and he
showed regret at his remark. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be
thinkin&#8217; of a lad when the young girls are needin&#8217;
help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the girls are all right,&#8221; Jack assured the
old seaman; &#8220;but say, Dray,&#8221; he called, &#8220;what&#8217;s
the matter, anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just give me a line and tow me in, then we will
hold a post mortem,&#8221; replied Dray, good humoredly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy taking her apart out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Marita, &#8220;then we can go
for Cora and Lottie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>Promptly the brand new rope of the <i>Chelton</i>
was tossed to the disabled boat and fastened, then
the two boats started for shore.
</p>
<p>Cora and Lottie were waiting. The latter had
shed her wet &#8220;garments of vanity,&#8221; as Belle described
them, for a simple brown linen frock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; called Cora, as the boats
neared shore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mis-happened,&#8221; answered Dray. &#8220;It was
just fate. We couldn&#8217;t expect to beat the motor
girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice of you,&#8221; acknowledged Cora, &#8220;but I am
sorry if there is anything wrong with your beautiful
boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the boat and not the boy,&#8221; remarked Ed.
&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll do as much for you some day, Cora.
Wait until we get our little <i>Lassie</i> out. She,
being a mere girl, may have a show.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Lottie?&#8221; asked Bess, as
they landed and the girls noted that Lottie was
remarkably quiet, and even a trifle pale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; Cora hurriedly answered, while
she crushed her fingers on Lottie&#8217;s arm. &#8220;We
were detained at the bungalow, that&#8217;s all. We&#8217;ll
tell you all about it later on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls gathered around Cora and Lottie at
this remark. But Cora, by some mysterious signal
system, had warned Lottie not to say anything,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
and she soon joined the boys, who had already
boarded the <i>Dixie</i> to overhaul her.
</p>
<p>They looked at the engine, at the spark plugs,
at the cylinder, but Cora, who happened to have
more room at the point where the carbureter was
situated, suddenly exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it! Water in the carbureter!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; confirmed Dray, in another moment.
&#8220;The spray mixed with the gas&mdash;dashed
over into the air in-take valve. Moral, go slow,
for water sometimes is fatal, even in a good
cause!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame to spoil the race,&#8221; said Ed; &#8220;we were
just warming up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; commented Denny, &#8220;and a
good lesson. I never knew myself that too much
speed would do the like of that. Well, I must be
off doin&#8217; some chores. I&#8217;ve been a-galavantin&#8217;
most of the day, and the fishes of Crystal Bay are
not educated to come up to me door yet. Thank
you for the sport. It was fine,&#8221; he concluded,
genially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you must come along again,&#8221; Cora
urged. &#8220;This was only a baby-trial. We will
want to be going out on the deep soon; then you
must come along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, very kindly,&#8221; Denny called, as he
started off. &#8220;The deep is a bad place for young
&#8217;uns, I can tell you. Better stick around shore.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us what is the matter, Lottie,&#8221; demanded
Bess, for Lottie had not yet recovered her self-possession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I had a chill,&#8221; she evaded, glancing
at Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the mere sight of a couple of strange men
startled her,&#8221; Cora added. &#8220;I have warned her
there may be lots of strange men around Crystal
Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not the same strange men every time,&#8221;
Lottie put in. This gave a clue to her fright. The
men who had secluded themselves under the
Lonely Willow that morning had appeared again,
this time in the vicinity of the girls&#8217; bungalow, now
known as the &#8220;Motely Mote.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>IN THE MOTELY MOTE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Do you young ladies realize that we have the
cares of housekeeping on our shoulders?&#8221; asked
Cora, from a mass of boxes and bags, not to mention
trunks, in the alleged living room of the
Mote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let us forget it&mdash;do,&#8221; begged Bess. &#8220;I
always hate the summertime when it brings dishes
and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good for you,&#8221; affirmed Marita. Bess
did know that hard work is considered &#8220;good&#8221;
for stout persons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, but it is not pleasant,&#8221; Bess answered,
flinging herself upon the improvised couch, a matter
of hammocks and blankets, still bearing baggage
checks and tie-ropes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But our housekeeper has given notice,&#8221; announced
Cora. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t wonder. Not one
has been on time for a single meal since we arrived.
But I must say, I wish she had stayed until
the stuff was all unpacked. It&#8217;s dreadful on the
hands,&#8221; and she looked at hers ruefully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not ask the boys to help?&#8221; asked Lottie,
who was doing her best to press her damp
clothes by stretching the most important of them
over Belle&#8217;s trunk, and holding them there with
two suitcases. &#8220;If I had not gotten these things
wet I should have been glad to unpack, but if I
leave them this way over night I shall never be
able to wear them again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knew the boys as well as we do,&#8221;
Bess put in, &#8220;you would know what their help
means. They would insist upon trying on every
article of clothing they unpacked; wouldn&#8217;t they
Cora?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that, Bess, if they did unpack
at all. But, seriously, if you will give me a little
help to drag these empty trunks to the porch, I
will tell you of a plan I have evolved. Of course
we cannot remain this way without a chaperone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it perfectly silly?&#8221; complained Belle.
&#8220;As if we were not all capable of taking care of
ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; objected Cora.
&#8220;I have noticed that in case of emergency, when
some strange man happens to poke his nose in at
the window, we are all rather glad to acknowledge
we are mere babes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And also when we meet them under willow
trees,&#8221; Marita reminded the boastful ones. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
am sure I agree with Cora that we need a chaperone,
and perhaps a policeman or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls paused in dragging the baggage toward
the front door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same,&#8221; Marita went on, &#8220;Lottie was
frightened to-day and she only heard a strange
man say, &#8216;They call them the motor girls.&#8217; As
if that was anything terrifying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was the way they said it,&#8221; Lottie protested.
&#8220;They just peered at us&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Lottie,&#8221; said Cora, &#8220;you have an idea
that everyone who looks at us &#8216;peers&#8217; at us. For
my part I was rather flattered by their attention.
You see the fame of the motor girls is spreading.
But let me now make my proposition,&#8221; and she
settled down on the rug that was intended to cover
the floor&mdash;some time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her &#8216;prop&#8217;!&#8221; cried Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know our little friend, Freda, has
lost some property; that is, her mother and herself
have lost a certain claim to it. This little
colony around here is fairly bristling with the prosperity
implanted in it by such thrifty men as was
Freda&#8217;s grandfather, but in spite of that, strangers
come in, make a big fuss about riparian rights,
and government laws, and property claims and,
in so doing, pretend to discover a flaw in a title
that for years has been considered perfectly clear.&#8221;
She paused, for Bess had opened her mouth twice,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and this time Cora wanted to hear what she had
to say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard some women talking about that to-day,&#8221;
said Bess, &#8220;and they said it was a shame to
take a homestead from Mrs. Lewis. They were
not whispering their opinions, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is a shame,&#8221; Cora said, &#8220;and if we can,
in any way, help to get the truth established, we
will surely have a good reason to remember this
holiday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; queried Marita. &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand
anything about land, and deeds, and lawyers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this everyone but Marita laughed. She was
not acquainted with the daring deeds of the motor
girls, as that was what they had undertaken and
accomplished in the past.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Marita dear,&#8221; Cora explained, &#8220;because
we seem such harmless babies we are able
to get information that others, considered more
dangerous, might not have access to. Now, let
me continue. There are men around here, members
of some sort of a land company, who are
trying to get hold of certain papers. We don&#8217;t
know whether they exist or not, but in our own
quiet, girlish way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here she was interrupted with a burst of mocking
laughter. &#8220;Your quiet girlish way,&#8221; repeated
Belle. &#8220;Why, Cora, I do believe if you thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
you could get the better of that land company
you would take the <i>Chelton</i>, and go&mdash;pirating!
Wouldn&#8217;t it be great to go out on a dark night,
steam up the bay, watch for other boats, listen to
the smugglers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Belle,&#8221; put in Lottie, &#8220;that&#8217;s not the way
in books. We would have to go out and get kidnapped,
and then, when in the cave, we would
hear the plot of the men who were going to steal
the old homestead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried her hearers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lottie for captain of the kidnapped,&#8221; suggested
Cora. &#8220;Now, Lottie, when it gets good
and dark you are to go out under the biggest tree
on the place and await your captors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there! Anybody home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys!&#8221; gasped Belle. &#8220;Now what about
having wasted our time? Come in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice of you to ask us,&#8221; groaned Jack. &#8220;Say,
we are dead and buried, and the will is now being
read. Somebody broke into our larder and stole
the grub. Have you any to put out at interest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stole your eatables!&#8221; exclaimed Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you could scarcely call it that,&#8221; replied
Jack, espying an undamaged orange on the window
sill, and making a lunge for it. &#8220;We did
intend to eat the stuff, but it was just plain grub&mdash;not
eatables.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, haven&#8217;t you boys had your supper?&#8221;
asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on a diet,&#8221; explained Jack. &#8220;Wallie
had the crackers, Ed nabbed the dried beef&mdash;he&#8217;s
the biggest and needs the most, you know&mdash;and I
got the pickles. Then we followed directions, and
each drank three sips of pure spring water. But
the trouble arose when Dray came in. He said
he was to have milk&mdash;doctor&#8217;s orders. We didn&#8217;t
have any but &#8216;pretense&#8217; milk, so Dray is now out
looking for a cow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then the sound of approaching footsteps
was heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They come!&#8221; announced Jack. &#8220;I was
merely the herald. Have you made out the menu,
Cora dear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say we have to feed&mdash;all you
boys?&#8221; demanded Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Feed us? No, we can eat with spoons. Just
lead us to the eats. Really, it is serious with
Dray. He has already gone dead white. Come
in, fellows. We are expecting you. The girls
are just getting out the best linen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dray, Walter and Ed entered, and like Jack,
showed signs of starvation. They literally fell
into the most convenient spot available as they
reached the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, ladies,&#8221; panted Dray. &#8220;We
are delighted to accept your kind invitation to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
dine with you. Pray pardon the togs. I feel like
a regular &#8216;toff,&#8217; don&#8217;t you know, but my studs are
for the moment lost. And what is a frock without
the studs!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if this isn&#8217;t the very utmost,&#8221; said Cora,
laughing at the boys&#8217; predicament. &#8220;Do you mean
to say that you are really hungry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we demonstrate?&#8221; asked Ed. &#8220;Do you
allow us? Belle, get out the chronometer and a
hunk of something. If you don&#8217;t soon you will
have a case of homicide on your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Finally believing that the boys were hungry,
the girls proceeded to empty the ice box on the
back porch. They did not find any too much food
there, for the sudden departure of their housekeeper
that afternoon had left the girls themselves
almost stranded. But, being girls, they managed
the living end a little better than the boys did.
</p>
<p>The boys, it seemed, had laid in a stock of
canned stuff, in the usual hit-and-miss way, but
some other campers found the &#8220;cave&#8221; where the
food had been hidden. It was out of the question
either to take or get ice, so the next best thing
considered was the digging of a big hole in a very
damp place. Into this the boys had sunk a nice,
clean, galvanized tub, and in it the victuals had
been placed. On top was a cover, made of boards
and oil cloth, and over this was placed the limb
from a tree, this last to detract attention.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, wouldn&#8217;t you think,&#8221; said Jack, as he
fortified himself with a sandwich, &#8220;that any decent
chap would know that we belonged to the
union? We are going to form a housewives&#8217;
league at dawn to-morrow, and then we will find
the culprits. They will be offering us our own
grub at exorbitant rates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bright little Jackie,&#8221; commented Bess, who
was devouring cheese and macaroons. &#8220;When
you find the culprits you will have a perfectly good
movie act in your camp. It will be entitled &#8216;The
Fate of the Kid Grubber.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the boys were thus engaged in the delightful
task of keeping off starvation, the girls
were anxious to hear what was the proposition
Cora had offered to lay before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way,&#8221; grumbled Belle; &#8220;we
never can get at the interesting things!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to tell the boys this minute,&#8221;
threatened Marita. &#8220;We notice, Belle, that you
brought out that lemon pie that was hidden.
Looks as if you found the boys rather interesting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you know exactly what I mean,&#8221; insisted
Belle. &#8220;Cora said we had to have a chaperone
and we all agreed. Instead, we have a crowd of
noisy boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When you boys have finished,&#8221; Cora remarked,
&#8220;we would like to clear up the debris.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Also, we have a sad announcement to make. We
have lost our housekeeper!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; almost shouted Ed. &#8220;I apply at
once. I can give every qualification, even to a
civil service examination. Cora, I never tasted
such food before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mutiny!&#8221; yelled Jack, making a spring at
Ed, which ended in such a mixup that the girls
fled to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We really cannot stay alone here to-night,&#8221;
Cora said.
</p>
<p>But the boys had come to their feet again, and
evidently to terms. Jack was hugging Walter and
Dray was smoothing Ed&#8217;s black hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the boys go and leave us?&#8221; asked the
timid Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they will, and that right now,&#8221; declared
Cora. &#8220;We have no time to spare to get
someone else to stay with us, however. Bess, do
you want to come with me? I am going out for
our new companion.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>FRIGHTS OR FANCIES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do hurry,&#8221; pleaded Cora. &#8220;I had no
idea it was so late. And it is awfully dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice way to scare me when you have got
me out,&#8221; objected Bess. &#8220;Cora Kimball, I have
a great mind to run back. I never saw lights look
so attractive as they do just now in the Mote.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run back if you like,&#8221; returned Cora, &#8220;but I
will run on. It was unfortunate that the boys
came in just as they did. I really have a good
reason for not wanting to stay alone to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have?&#8221; asked Bess. &#8220;I knew you and
Lottie had had some adventure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be silly, Bess,&#8221; and Cora laughed
lightly. &#8220;Everything is perfectly safe and sane
at the bay, but what I want is to get over to the
little cottage where Freda and her mother are
living before they retire. It is Mrs. Lewis I hope
to get as our housekeeper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lewis!&#8221; exclaimed Bess in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we won&#8217;t call her housekeeper. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
haven&#8217;t thought it all out yet; in fact, I am not
sure they will come, but I hope so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so do I; that would be fine,&#8221; and Bess
almost forgot how black the night was. &#8220;I met
Mrs. Lewis the day we came, and I could not help
thinking what a fine, wholesome mother Freda
had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been talking to her and I think
she is just that&mdash;fine and wholesome. And goodness
knows,&#8221; added Cora fervently, &#8220;we need some
weight at the Mote. But they may not consent.
I happened to overhear a remark this afternoon
that set me to thinking. I am afraid poor Freda
and her mother are in for further trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hurried along, making their way with difficulty
in the deep sand that covered road and path
alike. Once or twice they paused, startled at the
sound of men&#8217;s voices, then hurried the more to
make up for lost time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t we have one of the boys come
with us?&#8221; asked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am not ready yet to have the boys
know all our plans, and to trust one of them&mdash;Bess
Robinson, you know our boys. What one
knows the rest can guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; mused Bess. &#8220;Is that the cottage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, right over there,&#8221; and Cora indicated a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
light through the trees. &#8220;I am glad they are still
up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was only a few steps further, and this space
was rapidly covered. As the two girls reached
the porch, and before they had a chance to touch
the knocker, the door was opened by Freda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; she asked in a frightened voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Cora and Bess,&#8221; Cora replied, noting
the fear in Freda&#8217;s tone. &#8220;Are we too late to
come in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; Freda replied, reassured. &#8220;I
was afraid it might be unwelcome visitors, but you
are heartily welcome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The living room of the cottage was typical of
the seashore&mdash;a long apartment, with field-stone
fireplace and fumed fir trim. The stairway led
up from the room and gave it an air of even
greater spaciousness. Altogether it was most attractive.
Mrs. Lewis, a slim, fine-featured woman,
rose from her rocker as the girls entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is late to call,&#8221; began Cora, &#8220;but our business
is really urgent. We have been left all alone
suddenly&mdash;our housekeeper says she received a
hurried call to go back to her family in the city.
I don&#8217;t question the call, I know how often and
faithfully they follow maids who find a country
place lonely; but the fact is we girls do not fancy
staying alone to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course not,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lewis,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
briskly. &#8220;You must have some older person with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was plain, now that the girls had become
accustomed to the lights, that Freda and her
mother had both been crying. Their eyes were
red and their cheeks swollen. Freda saw that the
girls observed this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have been weeping,&#8221; she said, with
an attempt at a smile. &#8220;It seems as though we
have new troubles daily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221; Cora returned. &#8220;I wish we
could help you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you have done so,&#8221; replied Mrs.
Lewis. &#8220;Freda has great hopes that you girls
will do for us what perhaps lawyers might not be
able to do.&#8221; She hesitated and Freda went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those horrid men from the land company
were here again this afternoon. They say we have
no right even to this little cottage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No right here!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;I believe
they are just trying to get you to leave the
place so that they can go on with their plans without
being watched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lewis,
as though the idea was novel to her. &#8220;Then, indeed,
they will have more trouble than brow-beating
to get us to leave Crystal Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must hurry with my errand,&#8221; said Cora.
&#8220;I came to see if it would be possible for you and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Freda to lock up and come over with us to-night.
I am afraid those land sharks have our little place
marked, too, for they have been loitering around
all day. I don&#8217;t want to tell the boys. They are
hasty and so apt to resent any intrusion that would
worry us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the men bother you?&#8221; asked
Mrs. Lewis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose because they know that Freda is a
friend of ours,&#8221; replied Cora. &#8220;But don&#8217;t worry
about them bothering us, all we want is to be able
to meet them fairly. Of course if they knew we
were alone at night they might be mean enough to
frighten us, and some of the girls are rather
timid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, we will lock up at once,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Lewis, &#8220;and go right over with you. We
have not many treasures now to be afraid of
losing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is splendid!&#8221; Cora cried. Freda immediately
went about fastening the windows and
seeing to the general locking up, while Mrs. Lewis
hurried up stairs to pack a small bag. It seemed
as though they were ready almost instantly, much
to the relief of Bess, who kept wondering if the
boys would remain at the bungalow with the girls
until her own and Cora&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are off,&#8221; said Mrs. Lewis, looking
back at her home with a wistful sigh. She seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to have a premonition that leaving it meant more
than appeared at the moment.
</p>
<p>Freda walked with Bess while Mrs. Lewis and
Cora kept close behind them. They had not more
than reached the turn that led to the direct path
when shouts and laughter were heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the girls,&#8221; Bess exclaimed. &#8220;They
are looking for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The surmise was correct, for directly the answer
came back to the familiar camp call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;On the pine
path.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Belle. &#8220;We have had the
greatest fright! Where have you been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Making a call,&#8221; replied Cora, calmly. &#8220;What
was your fright?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along and I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; Belle replied.
Then she saw Freda and Mrs. Lewis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have brought protectors,&#8221; Cora said.
&#8220;Mrs. Lewis and Freda are going to spend the
night with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, splendid!&#8221; exclaimed Marita. &#8220;I was
so afraid we would have to stay alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the boys?&#8221; Cora asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone from the beach came up and said
Dray&#8217;s boat was loose, and of course, they had to
all go at once to tie it up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than to let it drift,&#8221; Cora said, &#8220;but I
am sorry if you were timid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we were not,&#8221; declared Belle, stoutly.
&#8220;Only we distinctly heard someone on the back
porch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At our ice box!&#8221; gasped Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we never thought of that!&#8221; exclaimed
Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then likely we will be without breakfast,&#8221;
responded Cora. &#8220;But here we are. Who has
the key?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Belle opened the door. &#8220;The light is out!&#8221;
she whispered. &#8220;Cora,&#8221; she said, aside, &#8220;I left
it burning!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A MERRY TIME</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I say it&#8217;s a shame!&#8221; cried Jack, indignantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly awful,&#8221; confirmed Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our meeting is at nine,&#8221; announced Walter,
&#8220;and when I went on the soup shift, I did not
agree to do the waiting. That&#8217;s not my part.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ed tucked an end of white mosquito netting
in his belt, draped it jauntily, and appeared ready
to do the &#8220;waiting.&#8221; Walter was frying bacon
and eggs on the oil stove. Jack threw dishes at
the oilcloth-covered table in imitation of a game
of quoits, and he rarely missed the mark. They
were about to have breakfast, and in spite of the
difficulties encountered in the way of modern improvements
omitted in the arrangement of Camp
Couldn&#8217;t (the camp got that name for a million
reasons), the boys were having a fine time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That coffee will be cold,&#8221; protested Dray,
&#8220;and my doctor says cold coffee is slow poison.
I prefer my poison quick.&#8221; The joke about Dray&#8217;s
doctor was that Dray never knew a doctor other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
than the medical inspector at school. He had such
astonishingly good health that they used the idea
of sickness in reference to him as a &#8220;counter irritant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this stove is a trifle small,&#8221; said Walter.
&#8220;What do you say we buy that one from Camp
Cattle? It&#8217;s a peach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Cattle crowd have a good stove they
won&#8217;t sell it,&#8221; replied Jack. &#8220;You will likely find
a second-hand flue in it, or a rubber hose leader.
Those boys are brilliant. If we need a new stove
let it be from Duke&#8217;s, with a cast-iron guarantee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o,&#8221; seconded Dray. &#8220;The cast-iron
is always useful about a camp. But I say, what
about the racket at the Mote last night? That
sister of yours, Jack, is wasting her talents. She
ought to be chief of a detective bureau.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora is all right,&#8221; Jack returned, proudly.
&#8220;And while we are on the subject, and not to brag,
of course, I might say that some of the other girls
are in the same class. First few years they came
out to the woods I used to be rather doubtful, but
now we often find that the maids can take care of
the masters; don&#8217;t we, Wallie? More of that
odor, please. I wonder why bacon turns all to
odor when it&#8217;s cooked up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only two more pieces of odor left,&#8221;
complained Walter, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like the smell myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right. I have had more than enough.&#8221;
Jack waved a disdainful hand loftily. &#8220;I believe,
as it is, I should be more careful what I eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A huge, very hard bun, the sort found only in
bakeries near Summer resorts, hit Jack squarely
in the face. Without any comment he caught it,
cut it in half, and with a tin spoon plastered it with
butter. Then he put &#8220;the lid on it,&#8221; and tried
to get it between his teeth. It was heroic exercise,
but Jack had been trained at a reputable college,
and had learned to eat what he wanted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But those duffers, the land men,&#8221; continued
Dray, &#8220;what are they after the girls for? I had
an idea one of them must be trying to claim relationship
with the fair Freda. He kept so close to
her when she was out after Denny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Relationship!&#8221; Jack repeated, with a laugh.
&#8220;You almost hit it, Dray. I guess the bear would
like to be her first cousin, for he is trying to get
her goods and chattels from her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we must not go into that; at least not just
yet. I promised Cora not to be hasty with Moran.
He&#8217;s the &#8216;gent&#8217; who is supposed to be president
of the company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The one who wears the Panama? I wonder
if anyone would think of haste in connection with
that duffer. It took him just one hour to buy
three soft crabs from some kids at the dock yesterday,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
said Walter. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t like to be his
messmate. But I don&#8217;t like his eye; it&#8217;s made on
the bias.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, always looks as if it were going to slip
out of the socket,&#8221; confirmed Jack. &#8220;Well, I
hope the girls won&#8217;t go in too deep with their
schemes. Those fellows are from little old
N&#8217;Yawk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; whispered Walter. &#8220;There&#8217;s that
Black. If he lays eyes on your plates he&#8217;ll lick
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The last morsels of food were crammed into
mouths before the call from the neighboring camper
was answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in,&#8221; Ed said, finally, &#8220;and help
yourself. Have you had your grape fruit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; sighed Tom Black, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel
exactly right this morning.&#8221; (He brushed a brown
hand across his brow.) &#8220;Nerves, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nerves? Grub!&#8221; shouted Jack. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I
see a can marked &#8216;soup&#8217; in your back yard this
a. m.?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Might have, but I didn&#8217;t. Else I would have
had soup.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were grubbers around last night,&#8221; went
on Jack, &#8220;and we thought we found a thread that
matches your sweater, sticking to a nail in our
grub box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My sweater is not ripped that I can see,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Tom, innocently, &#8220;but if you are so kind I
might take it. Don&#8217;t think we put our sewing
boxes in the kit, come to think of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be ripped presently,&#8221; announced Ed.
&#8220;We have reason to suspect the Cattle; in fact,
we have engaged counsel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The motor girls, I fancy, will defend you,&#8221;
said Tom, nonchalantly, &#8220;but I assure you, you
will have no case. We are absolutely without
grub; in fact, our case is pitiable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you had a &#8216;Doins&#8217; last night,&#8221; Dray reminded
him. &#8220;Now, Tom, we want to be fair,
but we have arranged to form a housewives&#8217;
league for the purpose of swiping systematically.
For instance,&#8221; (here he got a burnt match and
tried to trace something on the oilcloth), &#8220;if we
have company, and no olives, we could go over to
your cupboard, take a bottle and deposit in its
stead, say, a can of beans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; shouted Tom, tossing up his cap,
that landed on the flaming oil stove. &#8220;You should
not waste oil,&#8221; he said, as he rescued the cap.
&#8220;It&#8217;s always wise to turn out the stove when you
take off the pan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The meeting is to be held in our living room,&#8221;
Ed said, pointing outside to a bench made of a
tree limb <i>au naturel</i>. &#8220;When we have formed
our committees and settled on our constitution&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>This last word seemed to give every boy present
a sort of agony, for each began to &#8220;feel for his
constitution,&#8221; as if that important part of his
physique had been lost in the camp woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you could settle my constitution,&#8221; remarked
Tom. &#8220;Once I get that settled, I don&#8217;t
care what happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, quit your fooling,&#8221; returned Walter. &#8220;I
have an engagement and I would like to get my
housework done. Tom, help yourself to a towel,
and be careful not to wipe the plates on a glass
towel. You can tell the difference by the border.
The dish towel is all border, the center or hole
went up on the oil stove, a little trick our stove
has&mdash;it does not like towels. The proper towel
for the glasses is that one with the black line drawn
through the middle. The black line is not important,
it was put there with a single wipe of the
spark plug from the <i>Lassie</i>. Ed did it, very
neatly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tom took the towel tossed to him, and, as only
a boy can, began to dry the dishes that Walter
was piling in front of him. First he patted and
rubbed the towel on one side of the dish that lay
before him; then he turned the same dish over
with a bang and repeated the patting and rubbing
on the other side. After that he gave the plate
a spin. If it landed right side up he left it so; if
the trade-mark showed he counted it a &#8220;foul,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and tried the trick again. How boys can get work
done that way is always a mystery to girls, who
find the same play labor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I stay for lunch?&#8221; Tom asked. &#8220;I suppose
when a fellow helps with the general housework
he is entitled to his &#8216;keep.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we would just love to have you,&#8221; replied
Jack, with mock seriousness, &#8220;but the fact is, we
are all invited out. We lunch on the <i>Chelton</i> to-day,&#8221;
and he strutted around with such wide
sweeping curves, and twists, that he knocked from
the narrow board table every last bit of butter
the &#8220;Couldn&#8217;ts&#8221; had in their camp. Gingerly he
scooped up the top lump, that lay on the store
dish, but the scraps had to be scraped up with the
egg turner, and the spot on the floor (they had a
board floor in the camp) had to be washed up
with the dish water, when Walter finally relinquished
that important commodity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More careful next time,&#8221; commanded Dray.
&#8220;I&#8217;m off to call the meeting. Where&#8217;s that dinner
bell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The &#8220;bell,&#8221; a very old and very large tray,
was found outside under the bench, and with a
good strong stick Dray beat it furiously, until it
might easily be heard by every camper on the
grounds. At the first signal boys came scampering
from all directions. Some carried towels&mdash;too
much excited to drop them in their camps;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
others dashed through the woods with sweaters on
their arms, and reluctant neckties in their fists,
for it was early and the campers had scarcely
time to make &#8220;careful&#8221; toilets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grub?&#8221; they asked in chorus. &#8220;Let us see
it? Lead us to it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grub nothing!&#8221; replied Walter. &#8220;You just
get outside on that bench, the overflow can take
the reserved seats on the nice green moss. This
meeting has been called for the purpose of organizing
the Housewives&#8217; League of Crystal Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aoo-oo-ou&mdash;oh!&#8221; came a groaning reply
from those who felt able to groan. &#8220;And I left
sugar in my coffee cup,&#8221; wailed he with the dish
towel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there were perfectly good crumbs at my
place,&#8221; sighed Teddy, a boy with so many colors
in his face that they called him &#8220;Rainbow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to order!&#8221; called Jack, banging on the
tent table, which was to serve as the chairman&#8217;s
desk. &#8220;Every camp must qualify.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do! We do!&#8221; shouted the majority, the
rest being engaged in a rough and tumble for
places near the &#8220;door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose of this meeting,&#8221; went on Jack,
ducking a lump of moss tossed in lieu of a bouquet,
&#8220;is to formulate plans, whereby the humans of
Prowlers&#8217; Paradise may continue to defy the birds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
of the air, and the beasts of the field, and live in
a perfectly human way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the humans!&#8221; shouted Rainbow,
and the cheers that followed did more than merely
consume time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me explain,&#8221; interrupted Dray, pushing
Jack from his place, and taking the stand pompously.
&#8220;We have been the victims of prowlers.
We have lost our soup; we also lost our cans of
milk&mdash;in fact, the cruel ones took everything but
our appetites, and now we propose to put a stop
to such depredations. We will form a league to
borrow and to lend, also to pay back, but he who
taketh his brother&#8217;s soup and returneth not a can
of beans shall be expelled from the Prowlers&#8217;
Paradise!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We did lose five small cans of milk,&#8221; reiterated
Walter to Dave, the head or chief of a big
camp called &#8220;We-like-it,&#8221; &#8220;and if we find the
rowdy who took that he shall be court-martialed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A commotion then started that broke up the
meeting. The boys, in rolling and tumbling about,
rolled Dainty, so-called because he never could
get enough to eat, and because his quest showed
in unweighable pounds of fat, deliberately down
the small hill at the side of Camp Couldn&#8217;t. Two
of the Cattle did the rolling, and as Dainty made
one full turn a can of milk squirmed out of his
pocket.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Robber! Thief! Traitor!&#8221; screamed the
rollers, and then poor Dainty was lugged back to
the camp.
</p>
<p>Making the charge against him, and making an
example of him would be too sad a tale for words;
sufficient to say that the meeting adjourned at the
request of a peace commission.
</p>
<p>When the last visitor had been &#8220;shooed&#8221; away
and the Couldn&#8217;ts had carefully prepared for the
lunch to be taken on the <i>Chelton</i> (although Ed
claimed that Walter had appropriated his most
becoming tie, and that the shade of tan rather
marred Wallie&#8217;s own &#8220;tannery&#8221; effect), the boys
finally put the camp flap down good and tight, and
were off to the bay.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>TOO MUCH JOY</h3>
</div>

<p>Far out in the pretty bay the <i>Chelton</i> was anchored.
It was arranged that the luncheon should
be given too far from land to get anything in supplies
that might have been forgotten. In fact, it
was to be a test meal, such as might be a necessity
in case of &#8220;shipwreck&#8221; or accident.
</p>
<p>It was such a day as sometimes makes early
Summer copy Spring, when the mists of morning
mingle with the sun&#8217;s rays, and send up shafts of
haze to pillar the sky from land or water.
</p>
<p>There had been great preparations for this salt
water lunch. The girls, enthusiastic over the
possibilities, had vied with one another in arranging
the affair.
</p>
<p>Dray ran his boat, the <i>Dixie</i>, alongside, and together
the fleet of two comprised what the boys
termed a &#8220;White House Lunch.&#8221; The cooking
was all done on the <i>Chelton</i> and the eatables were
handed over the brass rail to Lottie and Marita,
who served as waitresses on the <i>Dixie</i>. First there
were lettuce sandwiches, rolled. Any girl who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
can successfully roll bread and lettuce is termed
proficient by the cooking teachers, and it was a tie
between Belle and Cora as to who did the most
and best of the rolling.
</p>
<p>With the lettuce came the greatest treat to the
boys&mdash;homemade crab salad&mdash;home caught crabs
and handmade dressing thereon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught the biggest crab,&#8221; declared Lottie,
handing the wooden plate to Belle. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that
fine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Finest!&#8221; she repeated, enthusiastically. &#8220;But
say! Why don&#8217;t the boys catch crabs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys did not waste time asking questions.
Lettuce sandwiches! Crab salad! They would
be serving frappé next!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat plenty of salad,&#8221; Cora ordered. &#8220;We
spent all yesterday evening crabbing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will&mdash;we&mdash;eat&mdash;it?&#8221; exclaimed Walter. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t dare look at a frying pan again this week,
and my term ends with the week,&#8221; he said, between
bites.
</p>
<p>Next came baked potatoes. These had been
done on the electric toaster, right aboard the <i>Chelton</i>,
and while scarcely a correct following for salad,
the first was given as an appetizer, and the
potatoes as food.
</p>
<p>The latter were served on the smallest of
wooden plates, with the most extravagant little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
butter plates&mdash;really sauce or cream &#8220;thimbles,&#8221;
all fluted and shaped from white paper.
</p>
<p>A dozen of these cups had been Belle&#8217;s contribution
to the feast. She spied them at the news
stand, over at the point, and could not leave
them.
</p>
<p>Dried beef went with the potatoes, also dill
pickles, and while Cora kept the electric toaster
going, and saw to it that the &#8220;kitchen&#8221; did not
run out of hot water from a reserve tank, the other
girls took turns eating their own lunches. Of
course, as the boys were guests, it was important
their wants should be first supplied, a matter not
easily managed, as the girls soon found out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;More! More!&#8221; called Ed, who was eating
the browned potato skin, or bark, with unmistakable
relish. &#8220;Potatoes are good for the nerves!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robber!&#8221; shouted Jack, grabbing a second
supply that had just been adjusted on Ed&#8217;s plate.
&#8220;Potatoes are good for the lungs, and I am&mdash;winded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like just a tiny bit more crab,&#8221; simpered
Dray. &#8220;Fish is good for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have something more,&#8221; Cora announced,
&#8220;don&#8217;t each too much solid stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Belle, &#8220;not if we kept
eating for the rest of our mortal lives, it wouldn&#8217;t
be too much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the &#8216;Likes&#8217;!&#8221; announced Lottie, indicating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
a canoe gliding up the bay, in which were
two members of the &#8220;We-like-it&#8221; camp. &#8220;Now
we will have to hide things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hide things!&#8221; Belle tossed her sweater over
her plate as she saw the canoe. &#8220;We are lost!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let us invite them alongside,&#8221; suggested
Lottie, who, up to that moment had been so busy
with setting out plates that she had scarcely spoken
to the visitors. &#8220;We have plenty of stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nix, nary, not much!&#8221; cried Ed, in protest.
&#8220;That&#8217;s &#8216;Dainty&#8217; there, the stroke, and if he
gets in here he&#8217;ll eat the dish pan and the cooker.
I say, young ladies should be most careful what
sort of fellows they associate with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But in spite of this the &#8220;Likes&#8221; were invited.
Possibly they smelled the eatables, for they came
up to the side of the <i>Chelton</i> as nicely as if they
had set out from shore with that intention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; called Dainty, the fat one, &#8220;we
would be pleased to,&#8221; although no one had asked
him to do anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted,&#8221; affirmed Kent, the other of the
party. &#8220;We sent our cards by messenger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The canoe bobbed up and down, until Cora took
an extra rope from the <i>Chelton</i> and threw it to
Dainty, who in turn tied it to a small hook in the
green <i>Snake</i>. This served to keep the canoe from
capsizing as Dainty and Kent crept into the <i>Chelton</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>Just what saved all three boats from being
turned upside down in the racket that followed
only Neptune knows, for in their delight at seeing
real food the boys from the &#8220;Likes&#8221; grew so impetuous
that the &#8220;Couldn&#8217;ts&#8221; felt called upon to
interfere.
</p>
<p>Crabs, sandwiches, potatoes&mdash;each in turn were
hailed with gales of glee, until the girls fell back
exhausted with the strain of providing and cooking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me, let me,&#8221; begged Dray, &#8220;I know exactly
how to handle electric appliances. I press
my neckties&mdash;with an electric iron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was over into the <i>Chelton</i>, and piling more
potatoes under the little tin cover on the toaster,
before anyone had time to answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turned or unturned?&#8221; he asked, surveying a
smoking potato critically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both or neither,&#8221; answered the famished
Dainty between gasps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take my coffee now,&#8221; announced Jack, sitting
back in the cushions, and flicking an imaginary
speck from his sweater.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you must wait,&#8221; Cora ordered. &#8220;We
have not caught up to you yet. We are only at
the entree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lottie declared she never had such a splendid
time in her life, and the brightness of her cheeks
catching the flame from her eyes bore out this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
statement. Marita, too, seemed to have &#8220;shook
her cocoon,&#8221; Jack said, his economy of language
scarcely making up for the little difference in
&#8220;shook&#8221; and &#8220;shaken.&#8221; Certainly she managed
to climb from one boat to another with remarkable
alertness, while Bess, Belle and Cora acted like
up-to-date society maidens, only they acted a little
in advance of the &#8220;date&#8221; usually adhered to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do we have to leave these shores?&#8221;
wailed Ed, sipping a real good cup of coffee.
&#8220;Why not anchor here for now and for eternity!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you liked camping,&#8221; said Belle.
&#8220;Surely you are not tired of housekeeping.
Doesn&#8217;t it run smoothly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied Ed, &#8220;but the grub is the
trouble. I wonder why mammas, with good moral
intentions, train little boys to eat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see those clouds,&#8221; remarked Cora,
&#8220;they are just swooping down on us, and we are
miles from home. My, but it is going to be a
quick shower!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young people had been enjoying themselves
so much that not until Cora spoke did they realize
that the sky had become overcast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m scared to death,&#8221; cried Marita.
&#8220;Those clouds are so near&mdash;you would think they
would touch the water!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, aren&#8217;t they black!&#8221; gasped Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, get everything under cover,&#8221; called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Jack, thinking first of the danger to the girls and
their boat. &#8220;Dray can get his awning up quickly
enough, but this one has not been opened yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys just tie your canoe tight to us,&#8221; Cora
said, as the two visitors were about to climb into
their frail skiff. &#8220;You would be washed out during
the storm that&#8217;s coming. Here, Bess, hold
this,&#8221; handing Bess one end of the awning tie.
&#8220;Belle, can you keep that rope taut?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was astonishing how quickly the scene of enjoyment
turned to one of alarm. Those of the
girls who were active and eager to assist in making
things safe, did not suffer so much from fright as
did they who took time to watch the clouds. The
first severe storm of Summer usually has a more
terrifying effect upon the timid ones than those that
may follow, and this one certainly was a &#8220;star&#8221;
for a starter.
</p>
<p>The lightning soon began to flash intermittently
and the thunder to rumble. The clear expanse
of horizon afforded such a wide view of the storm
that it was small wonder those out in the bay
feared for their safety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; wailed Marita, as one flash of lightning
seemed to dart directly at the brass rail of Dray&#8217;s
boat. &#8220;I thought I was struck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her words had not been uttered before the clap
of thunder followed. This had that queer, deep
sound peculiar to the water, and certainly the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
heart of the storm seemed to hover over the little
fleet.
</p>
<p>All over the bay sail boats, canoes, motor
boats, row boats and every sort of craft were making
for shore, but in most of these there were little
or no goods that might be damaged by rain or
waves, while both the <i>Dixie</i> and the <i>Chelton</i> would
have suffered severely had they encountered a
down-pour uncovered.
</p>
<p>The awnings were up at last, and Jack had
started the <i>Chelton</i>. Directly after that the chug
of the <i>Dixie</i> was heard.
</p>
<p>Then it was all storm! Raging! Roaring!
Which way could two small motor boats hope to
plough their way in such a fury of wind, rain and
lightning?
</p>
<p>The waves had assumed the proportions of
billows, and every time a boat lifted with the
crest, a huge bank of water would break over it.
</p>
<p>Jack clung to the steering wheel, and Cora
never took her eyes off the engine. But how they
whirled and twirled! There was the <i>Dixie!</i> It
was keeping near&mdash;one good thing. The canoe
had broken loose and was soon lost to sight. No
one bewailed it; there was too serious work at
hand for that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me look after the gas!&#8221; begged Kent of
Cora. He was at her elbow, but she had insisted
on personally attending to the machine.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know it better, perhaps,&#8221; she shrieked back,
&#8220;but stay close. If I cannot manage I will let
you know!&#8221;
</p>
<p>One terrific clap, then a roar sounded in the
ears of all, but seemed to paralyze Lottie.
</p>
<p>She fell in a heap and lay speechless. Up to
this time she had been half sitting in the bottom of
the boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s struck!&#8221; shrieked Belle. Then Cora
left the engine to Kent and took charge of the
senseless girl.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>The coffee that stood on the still warm electric
stove proved a valuable aid in restoring the
stunned Lottie. She had not been struck; her
nerves had simply given out, and she had collapsed.
</p>
<p>Finally she opened her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right now,&#8221; she said faintly, and it was
evident the shock had dulled her terror, at least.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just lie still,&#8221; whispered Cora, encouragingly.
&#8220;The storm will soon be over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The storm?&#8221; Lottie repeated. Then she
closed her eyes again, but this time it was only exhaustion,
not faintness.
</p>
<p>The other girls had been roused to activity by
Lottie&#8217;s condition. They could now see a rift in
the clouds, and one after another hurried to say
that the storm was breaking, and it was not so
bad; that boats could be seen, and perhaps they
would soon sight land.
</p>
<p>But those at the wheels of the boats knew how
little they could do in the way of steering. Every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
time the wheel was turned one way the force of the
rollers would wash it completely around. In fact
they were making absolutely no progress, and
might almost as well have allowed the powerless
craft to submit to the fury of the waters.
</p>
<p>Cora realized this, as did the boys, but the other
girls, except perhaps Bess, felt more secure as the
sound of the motor indicated motion. The clouds
were lifting, but the force of the storm seemed to
be coming in from sea, and had little to do with
the appearance of the sky.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if help would only come!&#8221; Cora whispered
to Bess. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid another and worse
storm is gathering!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up,&#8221; replied the girl, her own face
gray in the mist and spray that covered the deck
even under the awnings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;see&mdash;something bobbing up and down over
there!&#8221; Cora continued. &#8220;See! It is&mdash;a big,
strong boat, perhaps a lifeboat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope so,&#8221; answered Bess, fervently.
</p>
<p>Not one word could Cora exchange with Jack,
he was too far from her to hear her voice. The
<i>Dixie</i> was still near enough to be sighted, but how
the boys managed to keep her so was as remarkable
to themselves as to those on the <i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a boat, all right,&#8221; said Bess with more
vigor in her voice, &#8220;and it looks like one from the
life-saving station.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>Cora peered anxiously in the direction of the
speck that played upon the waves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; yelled Jack, &#8220;there comes Denny!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Denny!&#8221; repeated Cora wonderingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Freda!&#8221; called Belle, jumping up
from the bottom of the boat and promptly falling
back again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Freda and Denny, and someone else?&#8221;
asked Bess, breathlessly. &#8220;Oh, what a mercy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a boy,&#8221; declared Kent. &#8220;See the rain-hat
and slicker?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and see Freda&#8217;s hair floating out from
under that rubber hat!&#8221; insisted Bess. &#8220;Oh, I
know it&#8217;s Freda, and I can see Denny plainly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boat was coming nearer. On the crest of
a roller it fairly soared towards them. Then Cora
saw it was Denny and Freda, with another man
whom they did not know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Head up into it!&#8221; came a voice from the dory,
for even in a storm Denny knew how to make his
voice carry over the water.
</p>
<p>Jack heard, and swung the wheel toward the
left. That would put them &#8220;into the storm,&#8221; instead
of on the edge of it.
</p>
<p>At that moment the <i>Dixie</i> shot past and dashed
right up to the dory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; called Jack, &#8220;can you make it to get
in here?&#8221; This was called to those in Denny&#8217;s
boat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not now!&#8221; shouted back the man. &#8220;Keep
close!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The roar of the storm increased. Just as Cora
had predicted, the new squall was worse than the
first. For some moments all three boats tossed
and tumbled as if they had neither master nor
man, but it was the <i>Chelton</i> that righted herself
first.
</p>
<p>By an ungiven signal the three boats got into
line. The dory was directly in the center and the
two motor boats served to shield it from the
waves that lashed them on either side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! Freda!&#8221; yelled Cora, grasping the
line Denny tossed to her. &#8220;You can climb in! We
can hold it tight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Like a sprite, the girl in the yellow slicker and
rubber hat made for the highest end of the boat,
measured her distance to the <i>Chelton</i>, and while
Kent and Cora strained to hold the rope steady,
sprang.
</p>
<p>It was not the distance, which was but a few
feet, but the uncertainty of the boats&#8217; motion that
made the leap perilous. But Freda landed safely
in the <i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;None too soon!&#8221; gasped Cora, pressing her
arms around the wet oilskin coat. &#8220;See where
they have gotten to now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boats had drifted apart again. The girls
clung to Freda as if she had really brought them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
safely to shore, instead of adding her own weight
to their burden, but it was the message from land
that reassured them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it dreadful!&#8221; moaned Lottie, still trembling
from her collapse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; replied Freda, cheerfully. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
so bad out there. But we knew what it was on this
bar, and could tell by the wind just about where
you were drifting. If Jack will let me take the
wheel I will follow Denny&#8217;s orders and ride into
it. Then we can go around the island&mdash;and see
a blue sky!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue sky!&#8221; came the exclamation from the
girls in unison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. But I must have the wheel, Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having satisfied them that she could run the
boat, Freda changed places with Jack, while Cora
let her brother take up her watch beside Kent.
Then Cora went to the steering wheel with Freda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; the latter said. &#8220;I have
ridden out worse storms than this with Denny.
They have a way of turning things upside down,
but you are all right as long as you can keep well
on top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was driving directly into the smother. The
girls shut their eyes, and it must be admitted that
more than one put their fingers in their ears, for
indeed the roar was deafening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are Denny and the man getting into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
<i>Dixie</i>!&#8221; breathed Cora. &#8220;Oh, I am so glad, for
it must have been dreadful to row that boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> no joke, but Denny likes hard work,&#8221;
Freda answered. &#8220;Now here is where we ride it
out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Every bit of power was turned on and with one
well directed plunge the <i>Chelton</i> was shot through
what seemed to be a &#8220;comber&#8221; as if she had been
a submarine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Cora. Freda dropped into the
&#8220;V&#8221; space at the base of the wheel. Still, she did
not take her hands from the spokes. It was a
serious moment. What if the boat could not ride
those waves? The time it took to get out of the
harder waves could not be estimated by the hands
of a clock or watch; but in gasping breaths, thumping
hearts, pale faces and fears&mdash;for boys as well
as for girls&mdash;it must have been a long, long time.
</p>
<p>Finally Freda stood up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;What did I tell
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sky!&#8221; they all shouted, clapping their hands
like children.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;it&mdash;took a girl&mdash;to&mdash;do it!&#8221; exclaimed
Jack, who would not have been blamed
for hugging Freda had the opportunity offered.
Instead, however, he made his way back to the
wheel and allowed Freda and Cora a chance to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
look at their blistered hands, for both girls had
been tugging at the spokes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would believe a storm would end like
that?&#8221; said Belle, with the relief that comes so
quickly upon intense strain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got to keep in out of the rain for a
while,&#8221; Cora cautioned. &#8220;There are enough
water-loaded clouds over there yet to dampen our
enthusiasm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This proved to be true, for torrents of rain followed
in the wake of the vanishing thunder clouds.
</p>
<p>But the wind had ceased, and the waves soon
quieted. With more than a sigh of relief the <i>Chelton</i>
girls and boys fell into the course made now
by the <i>Dixie</i>, for in that boat Denny Shane was
at the wheel.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE CALM</h3>
</div>

<p>A more delightful scene than Crystal Bay presented,
two hours after the squall, could scarcely
be imagined. To the motor girls it was particularly
effective, as may easily be imagined. Coming
back around the island the <i>Dixie</i> picked up the
lost canoe, so this left nothing to be worried over
in the record of adventure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel, Lottie?&#8221; Cora asked, when
all had landed safely and stood looking over the
waters that could be so deceptive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am all right, really,&#8221; answered Lottie,
a little ashamed that she should have allowed herself
to give way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But be careful,&#8221; cautioned Cora. &#8220;Take it
easy for the rest of the day, at least. It doesn&#8217;t
do to try too much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandmother!&#8221; Lottie answered, with an affectionate
squeeze of Cora&#8217;s arm. &#8220;What about
you? Who did all the engineering in the storm?
And who is still &#8216;on deck&#8217; giving orders?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am strong,&#8221; replied Cora, though strong
as she was the last few hours had told in the paler
tint of her cheeks.
</p>
<p>The return of the storm-stricken ones attracted
crowds of bungalowers and campers to the beach;
for, of course, craft of all sorts had been caught
in the gale. The center of interest, however, was
the <i>Chelton</i>, for that boat had already gained a
reputation at Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>Not one person came in from the bay in dry
clothes; in fact, many were drenched, and naturally
the girls showed the effects of the storm more
conspicuously than did the boys. Bess happened
to be the one &#8220;who got the worst of it,&#8221; among the
motor girls&mdash;perhaps because there was more of
her for the waves to hit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly a beauty,&#8221; commented Belle,
who had been more fortunate in dodging the
water. &#8220;You look like a swimming lesson in the
first stage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I needed artificial respiration,&#8221; replied
Bess, good-humoredly, &#8220;but I want to forget
it all&mdash;all but this. Isn&#8217;t this wonderful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost enough to make up for the danger,&#8221;
Belle returned. &#8220;But wasn&#8217;t Freda splendid?
What good training she must have had to be able
to manage that boat. No one else except Cora
could have done it, and she was unfamiliar with
the tricks of the bay. I do feel so sorry for Freda
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
and her mother!&#8221; This last was said with a wistful
sigh, for all the members of the Mote were
now much attached to the motherly Mrs. Lewis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora must have known those men were going
to put the &#8216;for sale&#8217; sign on the cottage, when she
hurried so to get Freda and her mother over to
our place the other night,&#8221; went on Bess. &#8220;I knew
there was something more important than merely
taking care of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, that&#8217;s just like Cora. Fancy
Mrs. Lewis never hearing a word about it. If
she had been in the house when they tacked that
sign on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be perfectly awful to lose everything
that way; to feel it is all an injustice, yet not to
be able to prove one&#8217;s own claim,&#8221; said Belle.
&#8220;Tricky business men are worse to watch than
spiteful girls, and we always thought <i>they</i> were
about all that we could handle. There&#8217;s Ted and
Jean. Just look at their boat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Among the last of the storm-bound ones to
&#8220;enter port&#8221; were Ted and Jean, members of
&#8220;Camp All Alone.&#8221; They certainly presented a
sorry spectacle, as they came up to the dock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; asked Lottie, who was
down near the water&#8217;s edge, in spite of Cora&#8217;s admonition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like playing a spaghetti obligato on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
big hot bowl of soup,&#8221; replied Jean. &#8220;That would
be the song to reach my heart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun is clucking, girls,&#8221; announced Walter.
&#8220;She may set at any time. Is there aught to
eat at the Mote? Let us thither. We intended
to go to the store before tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After giving you your lunch!&#8221; exclaimed
Cora, in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, don&#8217;t you see, that is why we didn&#8217;t get
to the store. You are really liable for our suppers.
Don&#8217;t you think so, fellows?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only liable, but accountable,&#8221; added Ed.
&#8220;Of course we will go home and dress. I wonder
what on earth the squall did to headquarters?&#8221;
he asked, suddenly realizing that the camp had
had need of secure moorings during the last two
hours.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look,&#8221; suggested Dray, who had now
moored the <i>Dixie</i> securely, while Jack and Cora
had attended to the <i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you ought to see your tent,&#8221; sang out a
little fellow, who wore little beside a shirt and
bathing trunks. He had been out in the squall
and had, very likely, enjoyed it immensely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221; inquired Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all flippy-floppy,&#8221; replied the urchin.
&#8220;But some lady saw it goin&#8217; and she tied it back
to the stakes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some lady?&#8221; repeated Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Lewis, likely,&#8221; suggested Cora. &#8220;I
hope she did not go out in that down-pour to tie
the tents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather hope she did,&#8221; admitted her brother.
&#8220;I had some things in that tent not warranted
rainproof. Hey, fellows!&#8221; he called to the other
members of Camp Couldn&#8217;t. &#8220;Hurry up. Our
tent was struck, they say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the word the crowd from the beach ran helter-skelter
through the woods toward the camp
colony. Surely there was enough excitement
around Crystal Bay that afternoon to last for some
time, and there was every prospect now of new
adventures developing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any tents down?&#8221; asked Dainty, as he puffed
along.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of spilled grub?&#8221; queried Walter.
&#8220;Nothing doing. We have a salvage corps
department to our housewives&#8217; league, you know,
and they are bound to protect the members from
bandits. So you may just run along and see what
is going on at the Cattle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The storm had played havoc in the woods.
Pine branches had scratched deep furrows in the
white sand paths, beautiful bushes of blooming
mountain laurel and mountain pinks were shorn
of every bloom, and the wild roses were scattered
like pink butterflies on the catch leaves of shrubs.
</p>
<p>The first camp to be met by the boys was Camp
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Hyphen. This was quite a pretentious establishment
with a smaller tent adjunct. The adjunct
stood for the hyphen, and it now lay in a heap like
a discarded potato sack, its store of supplies settled
uncertainly in nearby bushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, and they had just joined the League,&#8221;
wailed Jack. &#8220;I suppose we will all have to put
up for the reinforcements.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not an insurance company,&#8221; Ed objected.
&#8220;Why should we make good for a
storm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we have a calamity clause. You had
better look up your rules and regulations, young
man. The last time I saw them they were pasted
with a daub of good family flour on our back
door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness the rain will have suspended
our constitution,&#8221; Ed replied. &#8220;That back door
never could have gone dry through the torrent.
Don&#8217;t you remember how the small showers
doused it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We do,&#8221; Walter answered, &#8220;and as we have
the only written rules, that same fact of the back
door may stand us in well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pikers!&#8221; Jack called them with a laugh. &#8220;But
will you observe the Hys! They are going to rebuild!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A hyphenated name seemed the worst of luck
for this camp, for there was no strong pole or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
cast iron bar to hold the two tents together, and
the &#8220;hy&#8221; was merely a strip of ground that gave
extra play to the wind. The smaller tent was now
being dragged from the bed of wet sand into which
it had partly buried itself, and the campers were
struggling heroically to get it back to its pegs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad!&#8221; called Walter, sympathetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that,&#8221; replied one fellow, who
looked as if he might have been shipwrecked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are insured&mdash;in the league, you know,&#8221;
shouted another member of the demolished camp.
&#8220;We are coming up for supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are?&#8221; returned Dray. &#8220;Say, fellows,&#8221;
to his own camp company, &#8220;the best thing we can
do is to take what stuff we find left and hide up at
the Mote. Those fellows will come down on us
and won&#8217;t believe about the washed-away constitution.
Who on earth put that indemnity clause in,
anyhow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Clem did. He&#8217;s studying engineering,
and I suppose he is lonesome for his math. We
ought to make him pay the assessment. But I
agree with Dray,&#8221; continued Walter. &#8220;We ought
to &#8216;beat it&#8217; up to the Mote, quick. There are
other tents flopping around, and everybody will be
good and hungry, you can be sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer how old Denny made for his shack as
soon as we got in,&#8221; Ed remarked. &#8220;I wonder
if he thought that would be demolished?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, not likely,&#8221; Jack said, &#8220;but the old fellow
was pretty wet and played out. He&#8217;s plucky, all
right, and I don&#8217;t believe we would be in yet but
for him and Freda. But he is old, just the same,
and only his pluck keeps him up to it. I would like
to have been more decent to him, but he won&#8217;t give
one a chance. We must fix it up some way,
though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure must,&#8221; agreed the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another,&#8221; announced Jack, as a perfectly
flat tent almost blocked their way. This was
evidently deserted, for not a boy was to be seen,
either lamenting or trying to right the canvas.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny,&#8221; commented Ed. &#8220;They must have
gone to the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotel!&#8221; exclaimed Jack. &#8220;Why, they borrowed
a pint of our kerosene this morning. They
may have gone to jail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s run,&#8221; suggested Ed. &#8220;This funeral
march is getting on my nerves. Besides, I am anxious
to see the Couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a few minutes the boys sighted their own
tent. It looked all right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank goodness!&#8221; breathed Dray, fervently.
&#8220;I really couldn&#8217;t stand any more nerve-racking
experiences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We look intact,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;I wonder if
my dress suit is still unwrinkled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your overalls?&#8221; asked Jack, mimicking Walter&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
tone of voice. &#8220;Oh, I am sure they are perfectly
all right, for I saw them in the wood box
just before we left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brute!&#8221; responded Walter. &#8220;But I say!
What&#8217;s that? We are inhabited!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sounds of voices issued from inside the tent.
Jack dashed ahead and raised the flap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbers! Thieves! Police!&#8221; he yelled, then
he had to dodge something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here for our rights,&#8221; sang out a strong
voice. &#8220;We demand our insurance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me the demand is rather violent,&#8221; replied
Ed, as the Couldn&#8217;ts saw what was going on.
The entire tent was filled with boys from the
wrecked camps, and they were making away with
practically everything in the line of eatables they
could lay their hands on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear out!&#8221; ordered Dray, &#8220;or we will call
the police. What sort of way is this to keep law
and order?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way,&#8221; replied Hal, a boy from the
&#8220;Mist.&#8221; &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t even keep up in starvation,
but with something to sustain us we might be able
to keep the law. As a matter of fact, it was civic
pride that compelled us to come in here and eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no help for it now, the Couldn&#8217;ts had
been robbed. Even their party paper napkins
were being made into balls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it awful!&#8221; moaned Jack, falling into the
one dry spot on the sandy floor. &#8220;And we were
the real benefactors of this ranch. That&#8217;s the
way goodness is repaid in this hard, cruel world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the sermon&mdash;everyone was too
busy looking for food. Finally Walter and Ed,
after a private conference with Dray and Jack, decided
to give to the unfortunates all the food they
possessed, &#8220;in order to avert worse damage to
their property.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are dining out,&#8221; Ed put in, &#8220;and it&#8217;s
only fair that you should take the provender
home. We want to wash our little faces, you
know. We dine with ladies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we will pay it all back,&#8221; declared Clem,
who was scooping up empty boxes in the hope of
being agreeably disappointed in their contents as
compared with their weight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;you&mdash;will!&#8221; mocked Jack, &#8220;when we
can skate on the sand of the desert. But hustle.
There&#8217;s not another scrap around. Land that oil
can, Ted. It&#8217;s empty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After considerable urging, ordering and coaxing,
the Couldn&#8217;ts rid themselves of their uninvited
guests, and were once again in possession
of their own tents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the girls invite us?&#8221; asked Dray. &#8220;I hate
to intrude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did not,&#8221; replied Jack, &#8220;and we are not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
going to intrude. We are just going over to thank
Mrs. Lewis for saving this camp from destruction.
She hammered down those stakes. Look at
them!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Ed, did you ever wield a
hammer as truthfully as that?&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>SUSPICION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Of course we can get supper for everyone,&#8221;
declared Mrs. Lewis, cordially, when Cora spoke
of the determination of the boys to come down
upon the Mote for tea. &#8220;We have plenty of
food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a wonder, Mrs. Lewis,&#8221; declared
Cora. &#8220;You always have a full larder. I don&#8217;t
see where it comes from, for you don&#8217;t even use
up the budget.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of experience,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Lewis. &#8220;When one has to do things, my dear,
one learns how. I am so glad we have macaroni
cooked. Boys love big, steaming dishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora gave a sigh of relief. What a blessing
Mrs. Lewis had proven to be! After finding themselves
shut out of their house by a trick of the
land agents she and her daughter had taken up a
permanent residence in the girls&#8217; camp. Freda,
in spite of all opposition, had installed herself as
&#8220;maid.&#8221; She insisted on waiting on the table, and
attending to rooms, and helping her mother generally,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
although the girls wanted her to be one of
them. Everyone declared that her mother, with
her wonderful management and activity, more
than made up for Freda being a visitor at the
Mote.
</p>
<p>Freda seemed happier now than when she
shared the little cottage with her mother, but this
was easily understood. Under the new arrangement
Mrs. Lewis was earning an honest and comfortable
living, and Freda was more than willing
to assist her in every way possible. Before, they
had lived in constant dread of the land agents
putting them out of their home. Even the fact that
the sign &#8220;For Sale&#8221; had been placed on the cottage
did not seem so unbearable, for the girls and
boys had insisted that that was only a &#8220;scare&#8221; on
the part of the land agents, and that while the town
constable would not interfere to the extent of taking
down the sign, he had promised to investigate
the rights of those who put it up.
</p>
<p>But town constables are slow and timid when
strangers, with big-brimmed hats, and plenty of
cigars, come from the city, and order papers
signed at so much per sign&mdash;for the constable.
</p>
<p>The boys had come, and the supper was almost
ready. Lottie looked as pretty and as well as ever,
for she had dressed in a chic pink frock, and with
a pink snood binding her brow looked as fresh
as though she had just come from the hands of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
a beauty specialist. After all, such vigorous
treatment and baths of spray as the girls had encountered
all that afternoon amounted to just
that&mdash;beauty treatment; and Lottie was not the
only one whose cheeks glowed, and in whose eyes
shone the light that comes only from youth and
health.
</p>
<p>The rumpus that always followed the boys&#8217; arrival
was in full sway, Jack and Ed chasing Bess
around the bungalow to make her give up an
imaginary lost scarf pin, while Dray and Walter
contented themselves with the less violent exercise
of rocking on the front porch, where the other
girls were scattered. They certainly were &#8220;scattered,&#8221;
for there was so much to tell and hear of
the afternoon&#8217;s adventure that each girl chose her
own listener and her own corner.
</p>
<p>Everyone seemed deeply absorbed in this when
Freda appeared at the door with the warning bell.
That meant that in five minutes the tea bell would
ring&mdash;only it was going to be dinner to-night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds fine,&#8221; Dray told Freda, who in
her blue linen sailor suit looked quite as well as the
young ladies who put in most of their time &#8220;leisuring.&#8221;
&#8220;Our Belle is not nearly as aristocratic as
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope dinner will bear out the reputation,&#8221;
Freda replied, a bit shyly, for Dray was somewhat
of a stranger to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner will make that reputation immortal,&#8221;
Jack declared, as he and Ed gave up their chase
and joined the others on the porch. &#8220;But hello!
Here comes Denny! And he has no pipe! Something
surely is wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Everyone ceased chattering as Denny Shane appeared
on the tan bark path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there, Denny!&#8221; called Jack, getting up
from his porch chair. &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A-plenty,&#8221; answered Denny with a sweep of
his cap that took everyone in the greeting.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Widder Lewis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the matter, Denny?&#8221; asked Freda,
aghast. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell me first? You know how
weak mother is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis nothing bad,&#8221; replied Denny, as he sat
down on the bottom step of the porch, in spite of
all invitations to come up and have a chair. He
settled his cap more securely on his gray head. &#8220;I
just want to&mdash;tell her something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; insisted Freda, who now sat beside
the old sailor on the step. &#8220;I know all about
the business, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do come in, Denny,&#8221; pleaded Cora. &#8220;It will
be easier to talk in the living room. We young
folks can go into the dining room and start our
dinner while you settle it all quietly among yourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss,&#8221; Denny replied, promptly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
accepting Cora&#8217;s invitation. &#8220;That will be the
best way, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Famished as everyone seemed to be, the visit
of Denny somewhat shifted the interest from appetites,
and curiosity strayed from the dining room
toward the living room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can have happened?&#8221; whispered Belle
to Marita. &#8220;Denny looks positively&mdash;angry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; Marita replied. &#8220;I suppose it
is something about Freda&#8217;s property; don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voices from the other room, that had been
subdued, now rose in tones of surprise. Freda and
her mother were both trying to talk at the same
time, evidently.
</p>
<p>Cora was serving the dinner and endeavoring
not to spoil it. The boys were too hungry and
too glad to eat to allow any interruption to interfere
with their pleasure, but the girls were prone to
whisper, and even to listen when a voice penetrated
the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was them!&#8221; they heard Denny exclaim,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll have the law on them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Freda said something like: &#8220;Can&#8217;t be
sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure as me name&#8217;s Dinny Shane!&#8221; exclaimed
the old man. &#8220;Who else would have tied up
little Brian, the dog that was never tied before in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
his life! Sure I&#8217;d like to &#8217;a caught them at it,&#8221; and
he brought his fist down hard on something.
</p>
<p>The boys and girls exchanged glances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something doing,&#8221; ventured Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet
Denny has seen the witches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;banshees,&#8221; corrected Ed. &#8220;Witches
aren&#8217;t ripe this time of year. But Cora, don&#8217;t let
us keep you. Really, Walter would love to take
your place up head there, when you have finished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora was anxious to join in the conversation
with Freda and her mother, Freda having whispered
to her that they would like to have her do so
as soon as the dinner was over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will be excused,&#8221; she said, &#8220;although I
hope you won&#8217;t hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed,&#8221; said Walter. &#8220;It&#8217;s very
bad to eat in a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll serve,&#8221; proposed Bess, &#8220;I know just how
much everyone has had, and how much more they
<i>ought</i> to have. Dray, you cannot have another bit
of pudding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dray was stretching far out for the dish. He
did love apple slump. And Mrs. Lewis knew just
the right amount of cinnamon to season with.
</p>
<p>A hush followed Cora&#8217;s entrance to the living
room. Not a single word or exclamation escaped
through the Summer hangings that hid the narrow
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s a conspiracy?&#8221; remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Walter. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we had dinner first. I had no
idea that a hurricane went straight to the hunger
zone like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be a star to go up North,&#8221; commented
Ed. &#8220;Just fancy carrying stuff in your
pockets and starving because the exact latitude for
grub had not been reached&mdash;wow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would insist upon being made chairman of
the latitude committee,&#8221; replied Walter, &#8220;and my
moves would be swift and certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door opened and Freda entered. She was
not exactly all smiles, but the serious look on her
face was not deep enough to cause comment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to fetch your coffee,&#8221; she announced,
cheerfully. &#8220;You must think we are planning to
dynamite something,&#8221; she added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, worse than that,&#8221; replied Dray, getting
one more spoonful of slump on the sly. &#8220;We
thought you were taking a negative vote on the
coffee. Nerves, at night, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you,&#8221; insisted Belle. &#8220;I am almost
stiff from sitting, or maybe it is from the
way I <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> sitting in the bottom of the boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; affirmed Jack. &#8220;I would not be
surprised if we had to come around in the morning
with nippers to get the kinks out. I see one
forming, right now, in Lottie&#8217;s cheek.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be stiff, I am sure,&#8221; added Bess, &#8220;although
our muscles ought to be in good form.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you have finished,&#8221; Freda whispered to
Belle, &#8220;we want to give Denny something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Belle replied. &#8220;How selfish we
are, sitting here &#8216;gabbing,&#8217; and neither you nor
your mother has had supper yet. I&#8217;ll serve coffee
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry,&#8221; Freda said. &#8220;We have time
enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Everyone, however, seemed to guess at once
that they should make room for the next &#8220;table,&#8221;
and the coffee was swallowed, hastily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Lottie ventured to ask Freda.
&#8220;We are just dying of curiosity. What has happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t tell you now,&#8221; Freda answered,
evasively. &#8220;I guess everyone knew we were shipwrecked
this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora appeared at the door. &#8220;May we come to
eat now?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I have only succeeded in
making Denny stay with the understanding that we
won&#8217;t keep him long. He is anxious to get back
to his cabin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am that,&#8221; said Denny, following Cora into
the dining room. &#8220;Can&#8217;t tell what&#8217;ll happen now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then something <i>did</i> happen,&#8221; Bess said aside,
to Marita. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine what.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must eat a good meal,&#8221; Mrs. Lewis
insisted to Denny. &#8220;I remember well how you
always loved macaroni and cheese.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I remember well how you fixed it up,&#8221; answered
Denny, gallantly. &#8220;This is a bit like the
old days; isn&#8217;t it? When I used to eat you out of
house and home, when Len would fetch me into
your house to tempt me appetite,&#8221; and he chuckled
at the recollection. &#8220;Freddie, you were only a
tot then, but you could climb on my knee right
smart. I guess you were always a romp.&#8221; This
last was plainly intended as a compliment, for
Denny smiled at Freda as she handed him his
steaming coffee.
</p>
<p>If the young folks thought that by special attention
to Denny and his wants at the table they
might get an inkling of the mystery that had so
excited the old man they were disappointed, for
he never betrayed a word of it, and only an occasional
absent look in his sober gray eyes betokened
anything unusual.
</p>
<p>He scarcely took time to swallow the tempting
food, however, when he jumped up and declared
he could not stay another minute, although Cora,
Freda, and Mrs. Lewis urged him to remain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must run&mdash;I really must,&#8221; he insisted, &#8220;and
mind what I tell you,&#8221; to Freda and Cora, &#8220;look
out for yourselves!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>AN ANGRY DRUGGIST</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to make a fuss over it before
the boys,&#8221; Cora explained to a number of the
girls, who, next morning, were seated about the
bungalow side porch, trying to get in a few
stitches of embroidery. &#8220;They would be sure to
go straight at those land fellows, and we think&mdash;Denny
and all of us&mdash;that the best way to do is
to watch them carefully for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what happened?&#8221; demanded Lottie, impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know exactly what, but it appears
that while Denny was out, fishing us in, someone
entered his shack and ransacked it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Burglars! What for? In that hut!&#8221; exclaimed
Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know that, either,&#8221; continued Cora.
&#8220;We can only surmise. They must have been
after something that was neither money nor table
silver.&#8221; She laughed a little at the idea of anyone
trying to rob the humble cabin of a fisherman.
&#8220;The little terrier is never tied up and never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
troubles anybody, but it seems he did object to the
intrusion, for he has a cut on one leg, made, possibly,
by a heavy shoe, and when Denny found
him he was tied tight to a hook in the woodshed.
Denny will never forgive whoever tied Brian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But did the thieves take anything?&#8221; Bess
wanted to know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing. Of course there was nothing an
ordinary thief would have any use for; but it looks
as if they were searching for something in particular,
for everything was turned inside out. Every
strip of carpet was pulled up and loose boards in
the floor pried away. It really is too bad for
Denny. He will have a lot of trouble getting
things in order again, and you know he is neat,
for a lone fisherman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that outrageous!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;I
think, Cora, we should have told the boys and had
them make a charge against whoever may be
guilty. They will be ransacking here next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, goodness! I hope not,&#8221; cried Marita.
&#8220;I think we should have police protection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And have officers ringing our door bell all
hours of the night because someone forgot to turn
out the dining room light, or the side window was
found unlocked,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;They have very
few officers here, I should imagine, and if we
really gave them something to do they might insist
on doing it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us more about it,&#8221; begged Marita, who
was naturally fascinated with the &#8220;scary&#8221; part.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know that his shack was entered and
all but torn down,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;As to who did it,
or why it was done, we can only surmise. But
don&#8217;t talk too much about it. We want to keep it
quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because by letting other people talk about it
we may be able to trace the perpetrators. We
could easily find out who knew it had happened, in
that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; Marita answered vaguely, although
her tone did not indicate comprehension.
&#8220;Freda and Mrs. Lewis are going out; aren&#8217;t
they?&#8221; This question implied &#8220;why&#8221; also.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Cora answered again. &#8220;They have
some business to attend to. I told them not to
hurry back for lunch&mdash;we would attend to it. We
really need the exercise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am going canoeing directly after lunch,&#8221;
Lottie objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After lunch?&#8221; repeated Belle. &#8220;This will be
before lunch&mdash;the getting ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know what I mean,&#8221; Lottie grumbled.
&#8220;It makes one&#8217;s hands so horrid to handle cooking
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you going to paddle?&#8221; asked Cora, innocently.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to try,&#8221; admitted Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your hands will be in better shape from
some active work,&#8221; Cora added, mischievously.
&#8220;It is awful to try to paddle with soft hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess mine are not any too soft,&#8221; Lottie
retorted, a bit abashed that she should have fallen
into the trap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Lottie?&#8221; asked Marita.
&#8220;You know it is only safe to canoe near the shore.
The water can be very rough sometimes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to go in a canoe until
you can swim,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;You know a canoe
is the most uncertain of craft, except that it is absolutely
certain to upset if you draw a breath in,
when you should send a breath out. Jack says a
canoe is more than human, but I won&#8217;t shock your
ears by saying what he thinks it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure there is no danger when one sits
still,&#8221; Lottie insisted, &#8220;but if you don&#8217;t want me
to go, Cora&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I want you to go, and have a nice
time,&#8221; Cora explained, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want you to
upset. You should wear a bathing suit and be
ready to swim in case of a spill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie,
rather shocked. &#8220;I am going with Clem.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope Clem will put you in the very
bottom of the boat, and not trust to a seat. Even
a big cushion is wobbly,&#8221; finished Cora. &#8220;Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
young ladies, are you ready for a tramp? We
have to walk to the old village this morning to
shop, unless you want to go to the dock and take
Frank&#8217;s ferry. He will take us across for ten
cents each, and we need things to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do let us walk,&#8221; begged Bess. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
seen half the things that grow around here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> grow around here?&#8221; asked Belle,
maliciously, inferring that the desired walk was
needed to &#8220;reduce.&#8221; A withering look was the
answer she received from her twin sister. Just
the same the walk was decided upon, and a little
later the wintergreen path was alive with voices.
It was one of the delights of Summer to tramp and
ramble; and in spite of the joys of motor boating
the girls were not slow to appreciate the pleasures
of dry land decked in various shades of foliage
green and floral tints.
</p>
<p>The mountain laurel was at its best&mdash;that little
tasselled thing we call &#8220;pfingster,&#8221; but which
looks quite aristocratic enough to belong to the
orchid family, made bouquets of itself in every appropriate
spot, while the glorious rhododendrons
put forth a display sufficiently beautiful and courageous
to last all Summer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my, look at the style!&#8221; Lottie exclaimed
as a party of young folks appeared before them.
They were evidently coming from the Cliff Hotel,
and made the most of that fact.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Hilda Hastings!&#8221; Cora said, in surprise.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know she was down here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A remarkably pretty girl, light-haired and wearing
lilac shades, with a parasol that reflected that
becoming tint, was Hilda. She evidently saw, and
recognized Cora just as the latter spied her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball!&#8221; cried Hilda, in the delighted
way that usually marks a meeting with a home
friend in the midst of vacation time. &#8220;Where did
you come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Hilda!&#8221; answered Cora, advancing to
meet the girl who almost ran to greet her, &#8220;I am
so glad to see you. We are stopping at our own
little bunk&mdash;the Motely Mote&mdash;on Pine Shade
Way. And where do you put up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Introductions followed, and girls from the
Mote were plainly delighted to meet the others
from a fashionable hotel. The meeting also resulted
in a general invitation from the Cliff girls
to the Motes to attend a hop to be given the next
evening at the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And do bring every boy you can scrape up,&#8221;
Hilda enjoined. &#8220;We shall be sure to need them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What dress?&#8221; asked Lottie the Vain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Linen or lace, doesn&#8217;t matter in the least,&#8221; declared
a young girl whom they called Madge.
&#8220;We will wear whatever we fall into for dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Lottie for all, fluttering
at the prospect of a real hotel hop. &#8220;We will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
wear whatever we may find pressable&mdash;we have
the awfullest time with wrinkles down here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind them,&#8221; answered Hilda. &#8220;Wrinkled
clothes are a seaside fad, you know. If you
have none you will be suspected of being the Press
Club Trust. That&#8217;s a clothing club&mdash;not literary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With other pleasantries the two sets parted,
but not until all sorts of invitations to come and
visit had been extended and accepted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What nice girls,&#8221; the timid Marita remarked
as the fashionable ones turned into the lane.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Hilda pretty? Are they from Chelton?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is and they are,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;But
I do not see how we are going to that hop. The
boys were going to take us out in a sail boat, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I would be frightened to death in a sail
boat,&#8221; objected Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And perfectly safe in a canoe,&#8221; observed
Belle. &#8220;Charlotte, that is scarcely understandable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lottie, turning a deeper shade of
pink, &#8220;I am afraid of that big pole in a sail boat.
It looks as if it would sweep one&#8217;s head off every
time it veers around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just duck,&#8221; advised Belle. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great
teacher of the proper mode of ducking; and that
is not to be despised, Lottie, whether one has to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
duck harsh words, or big poles. But I want to go
sailing. I can&#8217;t see what fun there is in going into
a stuffy hotel on a beautiful moonlight evening
when we can go out on the water and see something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we would see something in
the Cliff ball room?&#8221; challenged Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Peace!&#8221; called Cora, good-naturedly. &#8220;It
looks as if we might have to take a vote on the
question. But I can&#8217;t say that the boys would be
willing to accept a negative answer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t they come?&#8221; Lottie asked in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they will forego the sail,&#8221; replied
Cora. &#8220;However, we won&#8217;t decide until we
ask them. If they want to postpone the water
sport we may take in the hop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was looked upon as a reasonable solution
of the problem, and while some of the girls hoped
for the sail, perhaps an equal number wished to
go to the dance.
</p>
<p>It was a delightful morning, and the woods
were fairly alive with young folk. It seemed
there could be very few mothers or chaperones at
Crystal Bay, for even in marketing hours it was
always the girls with baskets, or the boys with
huge paper bags, who were encountered. On
benches along the beach, to be sure, &#8220;elders&#8221;
might be found sunning themselves and ruining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
their fading sight with alleged art embroideries,
but in the matter of housekeeping it was youth
that prevailed at the bay.
</p>
<p>It was a long walk to the general store at the
point, but there was a resting place there, and if
one wanted to tarry and felt like dancing, a very
accommodating young man sat near the piano
ready to play at the shortest notice. Belle and
Lottie usually took a twirl while Bess and Cora
did the shopping, but to-day having walked instead
of coming by motor boat they sank into a seat at
the water&#8217;s edge and watched others try the newest
steps.
</p>
<p>Around the drug counter a number of men were
engaged in earnest conversation with the salesman.
Belle needed cold cream and was waiting
her turn to tell the clerk so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We just about have it,&#8221; said one man to the
man behind the counter. &#8220;There is no question
about the legal right; it is only a matter of a lost
document. We may get along without it, but we
understood you were a life-long resident, knew the
people, and thought perhaps you could tell us
something about it. Of course we don&#8217;t want anyone&#8217;s
time for nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk scratched his head and looked over
his glasses. The scale was tipping with white
stuff and a customer was waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be so,&#8221; he replied, slowly, &#8220;but I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
should think, young fellow, that them folks themselves
would know more about their own business
than anyone else. Why don&#8217;t you go to them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think for a moment that anyone is
going to do themselves out of house and home like
that?&#8221; asked the taller man, angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the game; is it? Well, see here!
Do you think for one moment that I, Bill Sparks,
am going to do a poor widow out of house and
home to suit you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had raised his voice to angry tones, a remarkable
thing for Bill to do in business hours,
but those around who heard had no blame for
him. The strangers left without taking up their
cigars or paying for them. Bill looked after them
quizzically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to answer that sort,&#8221; he remarked
to no one in particular. &#8220;Too many of
them speculators around the bay, lately. Cold
cream?&#8221; he inquired of Bess.
</p>
<p>Cora had seen the men, although she was in
the grocery department, and when Bess told her
what she had overheard she looked troubled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must not put that off another day,&#8221; she
told Bess. &#8220;I am convinced that those men are
dishonest, for why should they go sneaking around
that way? Why not ask for information from the
proper persons?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Scarcely had she spoken than Mrs. Lewis and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
Freda appeared in the doorway that led from the
boat landing. Freda&#8217;s face was flushed, and Mrs.
Lewis&#8217;s was pale.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Cora asked, hurrying up to
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have started a mill dam across the
creek,&#8221; replied Freda. &#8220;If they turn that water
into use for mill purposes the whole shore of the
bay will be ruined!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go so fast, daughter,&#8221; urged Mrs.
Lewis. &#8220;We can stop them; we must get a lawyer
at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Cora, &#8220;I think they
call it an injunction, or restraining papers. Who
is your lawyer, Mrs. Lewis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any,&#8221; Freda replied for her
mother. &#8220;We were told if we engaged counsel
they would eat up the whole thing. Oh, isn&#8217;t it
dreadful!&#8221; and the brave Freda was on the verge
of tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see Jack at once,&#8221; declared Cora, &#8220;and
if there are not trustworthy lawyers here we will
fetch our own down from Chelton. The senior
member of the firm would do anything reasonable
for our family, and when mother is away she
leaves Jack and me full discretion. Let us hurry
back before the boys get out on the water. Bess,
call Belle and Lottie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The look of relief that spread over the widow&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
face was a more eloquent form of thanks
than words could have been, so without further
delay they all hurried to the motor boat in which
Mrs. Lewis and Freda had come over. It was
from a bay front hotel and had come over for the
eleven o&#8217;clock mail.
</p>
<p>The boy at the wheel started up as soon as all
were seated, and as the launch was a good-sized
one the trip across the bay was both comfortable
and enjoyable. Of course Belle and Lottie wanted
to know more than they could be told about the
coming of Freda and Mrs. Lewis, so they had to
content themselves with a word and a look from
Cora.
</p>
<p>The boys were at the landing as the boat came
in. This was exactly what Cora had wished for.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>AN ALARM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I will go to Lamberton this afternoon,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Lewis, after having conferred with
Cora and Jack. &#8220;I know a man there who was
a great friend of my husband. He told me to
come to him any time I needed advice, and he is
a prominent lawyer. I have never troubled him&mdash;had
no good cause to until now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that would be a good plan,&#8221; Jack
agreed. &#8220;I fancy as soon as we come down on
those fellows good and hard, they will be forced
to show their hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it was arranged that Mrs. Lewis should go
to the town, some twenty-five miles away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Freda,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry if I am
not back until the last train, for if he should happen
to be in New York I will wait for him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful of that cut in the old road,&#8221; Freda
warned. &#8220;Mother, you know it is always dark
through there, even in broad daylight, and after
dark it is pitchy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get any train until one o&#8217;clock,&#8221; went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
on Mrs. Lewis, &#8220;so, Freda, we will hurry back to
the bungalow and leave everything ready for tea.
We can prepare things while the girls are lunching.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you needn&#8217;t do anything of the kind,&#8221;
objected Cora, &#8220;we girls can well enough take
care of ourselves once in a while. Why, Mrs.
Lewis, you have us all spoiled. We are supposed
to do most of our own housekeeping in Summer
camp, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you do that now,&#8221; returned Mrs.
Lewis, who was more than grateful for the opportunity
for work that Cora had afforded to her.
&#8220;I like housekeeping when there is someone to
keep for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had Freda,&#8221; Jack reminded her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she wouldn&#8217;t let me do enough to keep
in practice,&#8221; replied Mrs. Lewis. &#8220;Here we are,
and the young ladies are stringing beans!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is what I call sweet of you,&#8221; Jack
observed as he greeted the four girls, all seated
around a low porch table with knives and beans
plying from basket to pan. &#8220;Who told you we
were coming to dine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You positively are not, Brother Jack,&#8221; Cora
declared. &#8220;You boys think our place is an elastic
delicatessen. Why, we never know whether we
are going to have enough for another meal or not,
and we can&#8217;t go to the point again to-day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Little Sister. If you have the heart
to eat good string beans from old Henry&#8217;s garden,
and know that your brother is starving for a single
spoonful, just go ahead. They will rest heavy
on your heart, though. I warn you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may help!&#8221; offered Lottie. &#8220;Just take
that paper bag and scoop up the ends. Bess spilled
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I absolutely refuse,&#8221; replied Jack, haughtily,
&#8220;to be a scraper-up for such mean people. No,
sir! I have just been manicured,&#8221; and he gazed
lovingly at his much-neglected hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem as if all we do is to get ready
to eat and then eat,&#8221; said Belle with a sigh. &#8220;I
would never keep house for myself if I starved.
At least, I would manage on fewer meals. We
have only been to the point since breakfast and
now it is time to eat again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora had gone in with Freda and Mrs. Lewis
and very soon afterward luncheon was announced&mdash;the
beans were laid over for the evening meal.
Jack stayed, of course, and wondered (so he said)
why the other fellows did not come in search of
him.
</p>
<p>An hour or two later Mrs. Lewis hurried off to
the little station, after promising Freda that she
would be most careful of the dark road known as
the &#8220;Cut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For, Mother dear,&#8221; warned Freda, &#8220;I do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
believe those land sharks would do almost anything
to scare the information out of us. They
have threatened to have it at any cost, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I am surprised at you being so nervous,
dear,&#8221; replied the mother, kissing Freda reassuringly.
&#8220;I never felt less nervous. In fact, I think
now things will soon be righted. Good-bye, dear.
And have a good time with your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda watched the little woman step lightly
away over the white path. Then, with a sigh, she
turned back to the bungalow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Freda! Freda!&#8221; called Bess. &#8220;You have not
eaten yet, and I&#8217;m to do the dishes. Hurry this
minute and just fill up! I must be finished in
time for a nap, for I am nearly dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda did eat, though somehow she felt unusually
depressed. Even Cora&#8217;s encouraging words,
given into Freda&#8217;s ear when no one else was at
hand, did not seem to cheer her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just come down to the bay and go out with
me,&#8221; urged Cora. &#8220;I want to try the boat with
the new control, and I don&#8217;t want to go out
alone!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will go with you,&#8221; assented Freda.
&#8220;I have only to change my blouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The motor trip was delightful. The <i>Chelton</i>
seemed to have missed the guiding hand of its
fair owner, for while the new piece of mechanism
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
was being put in Cora had not been using the
boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How different from the one we rode in this
morning,&#8221; Freda remarked. &#8220;I always feel as if
something were going to explode when I sit near
a noise such as that old engine made. I wonder
that a big house like the Laurel can keep such a
tub.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Guests are always glad to get on the water,&#8221;
answered Cora, &#8220;and I suppose they are not particular
as long as they do not have to pay extra
for the sail. Most of the hotels down here hire
out their launches, I believe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They headed straight for the island, and then
ran around it to come back on the east shore. In
many of the passing boats were young friends of
Cora, and all sorts of messages were shouted back
and forth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I had better go in early,&#8221; Cora remarked,
&#8220;as we really have not decided on this
evening&#8217;s plans. Some want the hop and others
want the sail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have a lot to do, too,&#8221; Freda said.
&#8220;Mother and I have to take so much time from
what we would like to do for you girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora protested against this, of course, declaring
that the girls never had such help before, and
regretting that Freda should take the matter so
seriously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot get over the attempt to rob Denny,&#8221;
Cora went on, as they neared the bungalow. &#8220;I
am glad they chose a time when he was not
around, for he would certainly fight. He thinks
he has the same strength he enjoyed years ago,
and I hate to think what might have happened
had he met those fellows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it awful?&#8221; commented Freda. &#8220;And
to think that it must have been on our account, for
I am convinced that those men were searching for
papers they believe Denny has.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt about it,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;But he has
none; has he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has never mentioned such a thing, and
with us worrying as we are, I am sure that if he
had any of our papers he would show them to
mother. I know my grandfather trusted him more
than he even trusted my father, his own son; but
that is easy to understand, for Denny had settled
for life here, near the property, while father was
likely to go to any part of the world, had he
lived. He always wanted to travel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a splendid afternoon to write letters,&#8221;
Cora remarked, &#8220;and I owe a very long one to
mother. That, at least, I will get off on the last
mail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some to write, too,&#8221; Freda rejoined.
&#8220;I had that very task in mind. I have to write to
those &#8216;in-laws&#8217; I interviewed last week. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
will think I am very ungrateful not to have written
since my return. So long,&#8221; she called out cheerily.
&#8220;I hope when mother comes back we will all have
cause to rejoice. That friend of father&#8217;s is a very
good lawyer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he may not be able to say much until
he has had a chance to look into the case,&#8221; said
prudent Cora. &#8220;We must not expect results so
soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do,&#8221; persisted Freda. &#8220;I know when
he hears all that mother has to tell him he will
be able to say something quite definite.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the girls parted, Cora to go to her letter
writing, and Freda to hers. It seemed the entire
household at the Mote was very busy that afternoon,
some resting for the evening, others arranging
the fussy trifles so important to young
girls.
</p>
<p>It was getting dark when Freda came out at
the side porch and looked anxiously down the
road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother should have come on that train,&#8221; she
told herself. Then she waited to hear the train
pass at the second crossing. &#8220;She would be on
her way up now if she came,&#8221; Freda reflected,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get my things on and go to meet her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Coming down the stairs she called Cora, but
receiving no reply she did not wait to find her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
She expected to be gone only a few minutes and it
was not worth while to wait to tell Cora where
she was going.
</p>
<p>The dusk came down quickly. Even as Freda
passed under the big elm tree she could not see
the moss at its trunk.
</p>
<p>She hastened on, and was almost startled into
a scream as she heard a noise. It was but the
tinkle of a bell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone on a bicycle!&#8221; exclaimed Freda, in
relief.
</p>
<p>The bell tinkled again, and through an opening
in the trees she caught a glimpse of the messenger
boy from the railroad station. He saw her and
called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A message for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A message for me?&#8221; she repeated in surprise.
&#8220;Who can it be from?&#8221; At once she thought of
her mother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the lad. &#8220;Mr.
Burke, at the station, took it over the telephone,
and wrote it out. Here it is,&#8221; and he held up an
envelope. &#8220;It&#8217;s all paid, and you don&#8217;t have to
sign the book; it isn&#8217;t a regular telegram.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With trembling fingers Freda tore open the envelope.
There was a single slip of paper inside
and on it was written in the hand of the station
agent:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you would do your mother a service come
to Wickford Junction at once.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Wickford Junction!&#8221; gasped Freda, as the
messenger boy rode away. &#8220;Why, how did
mother get there? That&#8217;s in the opposite direction
from Lamberton. Oh, there must have been
some accident, and she has been taken there! I
must go to her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastily Freda looked in her purse. She had
barely money enough for the ticket, but she would
go. On eager and anxious feet she sped toward
the railroad depot. It was getting much darker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Burke!&#8221; Freda gasped, when she
saw the agent behind his little wicket gate, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to go to Wickford Junction. Mother is there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is, Freda? Why I sold her a ticket to
Lamberton this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But there must have been some accident.
I just got a message from Wickford
Junction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, for I wrote it down. The person
wouldn&#8217;t give any name, but I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t
your mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it couldn&#8217;t have been! She&#8217;s hurt!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I&#8217;m not sure, but I fear she
is. She must have told someone to send it. I&#8217;ve
got to go. How much is a ticket?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five cents. The train&#8217;s due now.
There she comes,&#8221; he added, as a distant whistle
sounded.
</p>
<p>Freda had barely time to get her ticket and hurry
aboard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; the agent called out to her.
&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been any accident, or I&#8217;d have
heard of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Freda did worry. All the way in the train
she was a prey to nervous fears, and when the
Junction was finally reached she was hardly able
to keep up.
</p>
<p>But there was no sign of an accident, and her
mother was not there when she alighted&mdash;the only
passenger to get off.
</p>
<p>Wickford Junction was hardly more than a
flag station, and there was an agent there only
part of the time. He was not there now, but in
the dingy waiting room, where Freda went to
make inquiries, she found a shabbily dressed
woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Freda Lewis?&#8221; the latter asked,
starting forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. But how did you know? Where
is my mother? Did you send me a message? Oh,
tell me quickly, please!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, dearie, don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221; soothed the
woman in accents that only made Freda worry
more. &#8220;It will be all right. I sent for you to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
come here because I wanted to have a chance to
talk to you alone. Now if you&#8217;ll sit down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Freda, quickly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you. What do you want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to have a little talk with you. I thought
it better to take this means than to go to your
house. Sit down. You and your mother are trying
to establish a claim to some property; aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is well known. But what do
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that. I will tell you all in
due time. Have you any papers to prove your
claim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any papers?&#8221; asked Freda, suspiciously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;deeds, mortgages or the like. I have
studied law, and I may be able to help you. I
have had experience in many disputed claims.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Freda was about
to say that they did not know where the papers
were, when she thought better of it. Was it right
to confide thus in a stranger?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, dearie, tell me everything,&#8221; said the
woman. &#8220;You can trust me. Or, better still, if
you will come with me to the country hotel where
I am stopping we will not be disturbed. Better
come with me,&#8221; and in her eagerness she caught
Freda by the arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I&#8217;ll not go!&#8221; gasped the girl. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
want to find my mother. Who are you, and why
do you ask me these questions? Did you send me
that false message? What was your purpose in
so deceiving me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not deceive you!&#8221; replied the woman,
sharply. &#8220;It was for the good of your mother
that I asked you to meet me here. I will explain
all to you later, but not here. I can do you good.
Only trust me. Come with me. I have a carriage
waiting outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she caught Freda&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>Then the harassed and nervous girl burst into
tears. A kindly-faced hack driver, waiting outside
in the hope of having some belated traveler
hire him, heard. Dick Bently was a benevolent
sort of chap, with daughters of his own. Hearing
a girl crying he went into the depot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Miss?&#8221; he asked, and his
tone was reassuring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my mother!&#8221; gasped Freda. &#8220;She
isn&#8217;t here, and this&mdash;this person sent me a message&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for your good, my dear,&#8221; interrupted
the strange woman, with an evil smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying
to settle that property matter for you, my
dearie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, anyhow?&#8221; asked Dick belligerently.
He did not like the appearance of the
woman, nor her tone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary for me to tell you anything,&#8221;
she replied, with assumed dignity. &#8220;If
I am not wanted, I will go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it would be better,&#8221; said the hackman.
&#8220;Now, can I help you, young lady?&#8221; he asked
kindly, as the woman hurried off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only want to go home to Crystal Bay, and
to my mother,&#8221; said Freda, and she briefly explained
the circumstances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too bad, but I&#8217;m afraid you can&#8217;t get
back to Crystal Bay to-night,&#8221; declared the hackman.
&#8220;The last train has gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last train gone!&#8221; gasped Freda. &#8220;Oh,
what am I to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you worry a mite,&#8221; replied Dick.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll just take you home to my wife, and she&#8217;ll
look after you. Don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; and, after
some persuasion he prevailed on Freda to go in
his ramshackle rig to his home, where she was
kindly received by his wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back to the station to meet the express
that sometimes stops at the Junction,&#8221; explained
Dick, &#8220;and, Miss, if there come any inquiries for
you I&#8217;ll tell where you are. But you&#8217;ll have to stay
with us till mornin&#8217;, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Freda&#8217;s mind was easier now, but she could not
imagine what had been the object of the strange
woman, nor why she had sent the telegram.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the bungalow, there was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
much alarm when Freda was missed. And when
her mother came home safely, and found her
daughter gone, she almost collapsed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where can she have gone?&#8221; she wailed.
</p>
<p>Hasty inquiries were made, and one of the boatmen
told of having seen Freda start out through
the woods, and meet the station messenger boy.
After that it was easy to trace her.
</p>
<p>Mr. Burke told of the &#8217;phone message, and of
having seen Freda board the train for the Junction.
</p>
<p>And then a new difficulty arose. There was no
train to the Junction that night; but Mrs. Lewis
was in such a state that nothing short of a visit to
the place would satisfy her. There was no telephone
available then, the Junction station being
closed.
</p>
<p>Cora solved the trouble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can go to Hartford in our boat,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and from there it is only a short trip to the
Junction. We could hire an auto.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was done. In the <i>Chelton</i>, the motor girls
and the boys went to Hartford, making good
time in getting there. A neighbor came over to
the bungalow to stay with Mrs. Lewis, who grew
more alarmed as the night deepened.
</p>
<p>The trip by auto, which was taken only by Jack,
Cora and the chauffeur, was marked by the mishap
of a blown-out tire, but that was all. When the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Junction was finally reached, there, true to his
promise, was the hackman, and to Cora&#8217;s excited
inquiries he gave reassuring answers.
</p>
<p>Yes, Freda was all right, and safe at his house.
He directed Jack and Cora there, and soon all
were reunited. Then explanations were offered,
Freda&#8217;s fears about her mother were quieted, and
the trip back to Hartford made, where the motor
boat party was anxiously waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now for the bungalow!&#8221; sighed Cora, as
she took her place at the familiar wheel. A little
later it was reached, and mother and daughter
were together again telling their stories, and speculating
much about Freda&#8217;s strange message and
the mysterious woman. But the puzzle could not
be solved.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A BAD CASE OF NERVES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Would the boys have anything in their camp,
do you suppose?&#8221; asked Bess, with a long sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything for what?&#8221; asked Lottie, as she
looked surreptitiously into the mirror of her vanity
box. Lottie was always worried about the effect
of late hours.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it something to eat?&#8221; asked Marita in her
timid way. &#8220;If you want that, Bess, I&#8217;ll go over
and help you carry it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, I hope we don&#8217;t need anything in
the food line,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;I thought we stocked
up with enough to last the rest of the week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want something for my nerves,&#8221; went on
Bess. &#8220;They&#8217;re on the ragged edge, and I jump
at every sound.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And no wonder,&#8221; agreed Belle, as she went
over to a hammock suspended between two trees.
&#8220;Get something for mine, while you&#8217;re at it, Bess.
I think they use bromide, or something like that.
But I doubt if the boys would have any. They
don&#8217;t seem to have a nerve in their bodies, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
goodness knows they&#8217;re &#8216;nervy&#8217; enough at other
times. Pardon the colloquialism,&#8221; she murmured
as she sank back.
</p>
<p>It was the morning after Freda&#8217;s return, and
the night had been rather a troubled one. No
one in the girls&#8217; camp felt much like eating breakfast,
though they managed to nibble at a bit of
toast and drink some coffee.
</p>
<p>The alarm about Freda had giver the motor
girls the keenest anxiety, and while Jack and the
boys tried to make Freda and the girls believe the
woman and the telephone message had been a
joke, it looked to be too serious a matter to be
lightly passed off.
</p>
<p>The odd woman who had met Freda at the
country junction had shown, by her questions, that
she knew much about the disputed property. And
her manner had been, in a way, rather threatening.
It was too unusual to have been accidental, at any
rate.
</p>
<p>But Freda had reached home in safety. The
motor girls were glad of that, but they were all
suffering from a bad case of nerves, though, so
far, Bess and Belle had been the only ones to
admit it openly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take any of that bromide, if I
were you, Bess,&#8221; said Cora, as she straightened
out some of the things in the living room. The
usually homelike apartment had taken on a most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
woebegone appearance since the previous night.
Everyone had left everything just where she had
happened to let it fall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to do something!&#8221; declared the
plump twin. &#8220;My hand shakes&mdash;see, I can&#8217;t hold
it still,&#8221; and in proof she held it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does shake,&#8221; spoke Marita, in an awed
whisper. &#8220;Maybe she had better have a doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor! Nonsense!&#8221; laughed Belle. &#8220;Her
hand trembles because she had her arm up so long
this morning, trying to do her hair up that new
way. Sit down, Bess, and you&#8217;ll be all right in a
few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t sit still, that&#8217;s the trouble. I&#8217;m
so nervous!&#8221; and Bess hastily arose from a chair
in which she had seated herself, and began pacing
up and down the broad bungalow porch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea!&#8221; exclaimed Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it die of lonesomeness,&#8221; suggested
Belle, with a laugh. &#8220;Think up another and have
a pair of ideas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; replied Cora, promptly. &#8220;I think if
we go out for a little spin in the boat it will do us
all good. It&#8217;s a lovely day&mdash;too lovely to let our
nerves get the best of us. What do you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything rather than sit here and think
of what might have happened,&#8221; sighed Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re taking it entirely too seriously,&#8221;
put in Lottie, as she used a buffer on her already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
pink and polished nails. &#8220;What could have happened?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they might have taken Freda away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those persons&mdash;men or women&mdash;or both&mdash;who
are trying to get possession of the Lewis
property. And, in a way, we might have been involved,&#8221;
went on Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how,&#8221; observed Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ve given advice to Freda and her
mother, and if things went wrong some persons
might say we had an object in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;You&#8217;ve surely
got a case of nerves, all right. Come on, let&#8217;s do
as Cora says and take a trip on the water.&#8221; She
got out of the hammock&mdash;Belle could accomplish
this difficult feat more gracefully than anyone else,
Cora always said.
</p>
<p>Then they all went down to the little dock where
the <i>Chelton</i> was tied, and Cora, with a quickness
born of long experience, ascertained that there
was plenty of gasoline and oil in the craft. She
tested the vibrator and found the current good,
though at times, when not suffering from a fit of
stubbornness, the engine had been known to start
with the magneto. But it was not safe to depend
on it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all ready?&#8221; asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; answered Bess. &#8220;I guess I won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
have to have bromide, after all. I feel better
already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would,&#8221; laughed Cora.
&#8220;Marita, just straighten out that stern flag, will
you? Thank you. You&#8217;re a dear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; laughed Belle. &#8220;When Cora
begins calling names there is no telling when she
will stop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; was Cora&#8217;s answer, as she
stooped over to crank the motor. It started on
the first turn and soon the <i>Chelton</i> was chugging
a course over the sun-lit waters of Crystal Bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see anything of the boys?&#8221; asked
Cora, as she turned to the others from her place
at the steering wheel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s their boat&mdash;at least Jack&#8217;s
apology for one&mdash;tied to the stake,&#8221; said Lottie.
&#8220;Does that boat ever go out two days in succession,
Cora?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it does,&#8221; answered Jack&#8217;s sister.
&#8220;It was a sort of makeshift, anyhow. Jack only
got her running because someone said it couldn&#8217;t
be done&mdash;it was a sort of dare. But the poor old
boat seems to suffer from some intermittent fever.
It runs one day and rests the next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the <i>Dixie</i>&mdash;she&#8217;s resting, too,&#8221; went on
Bess, as she looked down the bay to where Dray
Ward&#8217;s fine racing craft was moored. &#8220;The boys
are not around yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Probably sleeping,&#8221; murmured Belle. &#8220;The
indolent creatures!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks who live in glass houses&mdash;and all the
rest of it,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;It&#8217;s nearly eleven, and we
haven&#8217;t been long away from the breakfast table
ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of carrying coals to Newcastle;
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Lottie, drying with her filmy handkerchief
a drop of water on her dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the pot calling the kettle black,&#8221;
laughed Cora. Lottie never could get her proverbs
just right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s all the same as long as there&#8217;s
black in it,&#8221; responded Lottie. &#8220;I knew I had
part of it right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On went the <i>Chelton</i>, and she had that part of
the bay all to herself for the time being. A little
breeze ruffled the water, and the sun shone
brightly. Under these calming influences of
nature the girls&mdash;even nervous Bess&mdash;felt themselves
growing calm, and at peace with the world.
The trouble of the night before seemed to melt
away, and assume a less sinister aspect. But Cora
could not get over the feeling that something akin
to a tragedy had nearly happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it may again,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I do wish
we could help Freda and her mother, but I don&#8217;t
see how. Land troubles are always so complicated.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>As Cora turned the wheel and swung the boat
about in a wide circle, she was aware of another
craft coming toward her. She did not remember
having seen it before, and as it drew nearer she
noted that it contained but a single occupant&mdash;a
young man, who, as Lottie said afterward, was not
at all bad-looking.
</p>
<p>The young fellow guided his boat closer to the
<i>Chelton</i>, and after she had done making mental
notes of the new craft&#8217;s characteristics, Cora had
an idea that the stranger wanted to speak to them.
Such evidently was his intention, for he slowed
down his engine, so as to muffle the noise of the
exhaust, and called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;On which point is Bayhead, if you please?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there,&#8221; answered Cora, pointing to a
promontory that jutted out into the bay. &#8220;But be
careful and go well out when you round it. There
are some dangerous rocks at low tide. How much
do you draw?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-four inches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too much to try the short cut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for telling me,&#8221; went on the young
man. He certainly was good-looking. Even
Cora, conservative as she always was, had to
admit that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going over that way,&#8221; went on Cora.
&#8220;If you like, I will pilot you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very good,&#8221; returned the young man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
&#8220;If it will not be too much trouble, and not take
you out of your way, I would like very much to
have you show me the course. I&#8217;m a stranger
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and the motor girls had been on so many
trips on land and water that they had learned how
to meet and accept the advances of strangers, even
when they were good-looking young men. There
was, too, a sort of comradeship about a motor
boat that lent a chaperonage to the effect of girls
talking to men to whom they had never been introduced.
Cora&#8217;s chums realized this and thought
nothing of her offer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; Cora called, as she opened the
throttle a little wider, and the <i>Chelton</i> shot ahead.
The other boat came right after, with a promptness
that caused Cora to think it had more speed
than she at first suspected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My nerves are much better&mdash;now,&#8221; said Bess
in a whisper to Lottie, as she stole a surreptitious
glance at the young man.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A LITTLE RACE</h3>
</div>

<p>For some time Cora held the lead in her boat,
with the other following in her wake. The girls
talked among themselves, speculation being rife
as to what the young man wanted in Bayhead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awfully swell place,&#8221; said Lottie. &#8220;I
spent one Summer there, and it was nothing but
dress, dress, dress all the while! Either for motoring,
tennis or bridge. Oh, I got so weary of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you liked it&mdash;especially the dressing,&#8221; put
in Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have, my dear, I don&#8217;t mind admitting
that, if only I had had enough gowns,&#8221; went
on Lottie, with a sigh. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t have half
enough. Papa was dreadfully poor that year. I
believe he said there had been a &#8216;slump in the
market,&#8217; whatever that means.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow I know I couldn&#8217;t begin to dress as
those in my set did. So that&#8217;s how I remember
Bayhead. I should like to go there again. It&#8217;s
perfectly stunning.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That young fellow doesn&#8217;t look to be any too
well dressed,&#8221; remarked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally he wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;going out in a boat,&#8221;
said Cora. &#8220;Something seems to be the matter
with his engine,&#8221; she added, for the stranger was
bending over it.
</p>
<p>Whatever it was did not seem to be serious, for
the lone motorboatist straightened up again presently.
He increased his speed, and came alongside
the <i>Chelton</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We seem to be some distance from the point,&#8221;
he said, with a smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want a little
race? You can call it off before we get near the
danger spot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora was rather taken aback by the proposal.
It was one thing to direct a stranger, even when
he was a youth good to look at, and it was all
right, too, to even pilot him on his way in strange
waters; but it was quite another matter to have the
aforesaid stranger invite himself to a race. It
was like having a beggar apply at your front door,
and when given a sandwich, calmly ask for soup.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Cora, but Bess
slid up to her on the long seat and whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do, Cora! It won&#8217;t do any harm, and it
will complete the nerve cure you have begun so
well. Besides, we need a little practice in racing.
We may take part in the water carnival down
here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if the rest of you are willing, I&#8217;m not
going to be the one to object,&#8221; returned Cora,
smilingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will&mdash;will it be dangerous?&#8221; faltered timid
Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit&mdash;you dear little goose!&#8221; exclaimed
Belle, putting her arm about the shrinking one.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve raced lots of times&mdash;and won, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Against such appealing strangers?&#8221; asked
Lottie, raising her eyebrows in a rather affected
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all in the game!&#8221; laughed Bess. Certainly
her nerves seemed all right now.
</p>
<p>The young man&mdash;he had refrained from
giving his name, either by accident or design&mdash;had
been bending over his motor during the whispered
talk among the girls. Now he looked up
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he asked, pleasantly, &#8220;is it to be a
race?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like,&#8221; answered Cora, calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do like. I&#8217;m going to enter some
of the Bayhead races, and I&#8217;d like to see how my
boat will go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a lighter boat than ours,&#8221; returned
Cora, who was not willing to give nor take an
unfair advantage. &#8220;And we have five passengers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; the young man went on.
&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to accept a handicap. I&#8217;ll drop back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
about five hundred feet and allow you that much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be fair,&#8221; assented Cora, who,
from having taken part in various races knew
what would be about right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then here goes!&#8221; cried the stranger, as he
throttled down his motor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a hail
when I&#8217;m coming on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The <i>Chelton</i> at once began drawing away from
the <i>Pickerel</i>, which was the name of the stranger&#8217;s
boat.
</p>
<p>This craft, it seemed, had a clutch arrangement,
so that the motor could be allowed to run without
the propeller revolving. Cora&#8217;s boat was likewise
equipped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to beat him?&#8221; asked Lottie, as
she moved back where no drop of spray could spot
her blue dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certainly going to try,&#8221; said Cora with a
smile. &#8220;What does a race amount to if you don&#8217;t
try to win?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, but then I thought this was
only in fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a race for keeps,&#8221; announced Cora. &#8220;And
I think we&#8217;ll win. That last gasoline we got is the
best we ever had. It gives us more power, and the
<i>Chelton</i> is running like a sewing machine, as Jack
says. I think we&#8217;re going to win!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She opened the throttle a little wider and the
<i>Chelton</i> responded instantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>A moment later there came a hail from the rear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Distance enough! I&#8217;m coming!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora glanced back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly was generous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a good five hundred feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks like a generous chap,&#8221; murmured
Lottie. She was again polishing her nails. Possibly
she thought she might be introduced to the
stranger, later on.
</p>
<p>There was the sound of a louder exhaust from
the boat astern. The young man evidently was
going to try his best to win.
</p>
<p>But Cora had no intention of letting him do so.
She had shrewdly estimated the ability of his boat,
as well as she could, though of course it was difficult,
in the case of a craft she had never before
seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit on the other side; will you, Lottie dear?&#8221;
asked Cora, as, grasping the steering wheel with
firmer fingers she looked at the course ahead of
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so comfortable here,&#8221; objected Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but the boat isn&#8217;t trimmed properly,
and she can&#8217;t do her best unless she is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like us girls,&#8221; remarked Belle. &#8220;We, too,
must be properly trimmed to do our best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trimmed!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
any frills on the <i>Chelton</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may later, if we win the race,&#8221; said Bess.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
&#8220;But what Cora means is that the boat isn&#8217;t properly
balanced. There is too much weight on the
starboard side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then I&#8217;m on the starboard side,&#8221; said
Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, or on the right, according to the new
navy rules,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;But, really, someone
must shift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I go over there I&#8217;m afraid the spray
will get on my dress,&#8221; objected Lottie. &#8220;And it
spots terribly, especially with salt water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll change over,&#8221; said Marita. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind
if my dress does get wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a dear,&#8221; sighed Lottie, as she settled
back among the cushions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a bit selfish,&#8221; thought Cora.
</p>
<p>The <i>Chelton</i>, now in better trim, skimmed
over the bay. Behind her came the <i>Pickerel</i>.
And, as Cora looked back she noted that the
young man&#8217;s craft was slowly overtaking her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has more speed than I thought he had,&#8221;
she mused.
</p>
<p>Foot by foot the young man urged his boat onward.
Clearly he was not of that false chivalrous
type that permits a lady to win whether she has
the ability or not. To a really athletic girl, pitted
against a man in an equal contest, nothing is more
humiliating than to realize that her opponent is
not putting forth all his powers. There are some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
men who will never try too hard to win from a
woman. This stranger was evidently not of that
type, and Cora valued him accordingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you get up any more speed?&#8221; asked Belle,
anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bit left,&#8221; said Cora, as she opened
the throttle a little wider. &#8220;And I think I&#8217;ll need
it,&#8221; she added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly is coming on,&#8221; added Belle in a
low voice. &#8220;Are we getting too near the rocks,
Cora?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s safe so far. But I think I&#8217;ll go out
a bit. I want to win this race.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>MORE SUSPICIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Cora Kimball well knew the capabilities of
the <i>Chelton</i>. She had steered other motor craft
in many races, and was aware, almost to a revolution,
just how much speed was available in a boat
of this kind. And while she did not know what
the rival boat could do, she was too expert at
water sports to use up her last reserve of speed.
</p>
<p>So, even while she watched the other boat creep
up on her, she did not open the throttle to its
fullest extent, nor did she advance the timer, which
controlled the spark, to the limit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be in shape to spurt if I have
to,&#8221; reasoned Cora.
</p>
<p>Foot by foot the other boat crept on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to win!&#8221; exclaimed Bess, in disappointed
tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure,&#8221; laughed Cora. &#8220;Remember,
we have been in races before, and in many a
seeming hopeless one we have come out ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls are just&mdash;wonderful!&#8221; breathed
Marita, as she crouched on the seat she had taken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know us yet,&#8221; laughed Bess. &#8220;Wait
until you see some of the things Cora can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe her!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, turning
for an instant to smile at the girl who always
seemed to be effacing herself for others. Then as
she saw the spray coming up against the bows, and
dashing over Marita, she added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you poor child! Why didn&#8217;t you say you
were getting wet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; was the brave answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must,&#8221; insisted Cora. &#8220;Here, put
this on,&#8221; and from a forward locker she pulled an
oilskin coat, flinging it back to Marita, as at that
moment the boat yawed when a big wave hit the
bows, necessitating a firm hand on the wheel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s getting rough!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie,
apprehensively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put away your nail-buffer and hang on,&#8221; advised
Bess. &#8220;It may be rougher before it&#8217;s
calmer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I wish I hadn&#8217;t come,&#8221; mourned Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to be ill, I hope,&#8221; said Cora,
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but my dress may be all spotted&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take this,&#8221; offered Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed, you keep that,&#8221; said Cora,
quickly. &#8220;There are more in the lockers. Belle,
will you get them out? It is a bit rough out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had gotten beyond the protection of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
arm of land that enclosed the bay, and with a
strong tide running there were more waves than
there had been at first.
</p>
<p>But the girls did not mind, save perhaps Lottie,
and her chief anxiety was for her dress. An oilskin
coat, however, averted this danger, and she
settled back in her place.
</p>
<p>Cora looked back at the oncoming boat of the
young man. It was within ten feet of her now,
and as she opened the throttle of the <i>Chelton</i> a
trifle more, she tried to get a glimpse of the controlling
mechanism of her rival&#8217;s craft.
</p>
<p>She stood up to do this, and, as she did so there
came a slapping wave against the bow of her boat.
Cora staggered at the wheel, and Lottie screamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; commanded Cora. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we roll so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There <i>is</i> a bit of a sea on,&#8221; admitted Cora,
calmly. &#8220;It will be over in a few minutes, though.
I&#8217;ll have to tell him we&#8217;re close to the danger point,
and will have to slow down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Determining to end the race in good style, Cora
opened up the throttle full, and advanced the
spark to the limit. The <i>Chelton</i> responded with
a sudden burst of speed that carried her some
distance ahead of the rival craft.
</p>
<p>But the young man was evidently not going to
take his defeat easily. The louder exhaust from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
his engine told that he, too, had put on more
power.
</p>
<p>But it was not enough, for as Cora raised her
hand, in automobile-signal fashion, to warn her
follower of an impending stop, the end of the impromptu
race course was reached.
</p>
<p>The girls had won.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; called the young man as he
stood up at his wheel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rocks,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;We can&#8217;t race
any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You won.
I congratulate you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His tone was sincere, his manner courteous, but,
as Cora looked into his boat, when it rushed up
alongside her slowed-down craft, she noted that
his throttle was still partly closed.
</p>
<p>Instantly a suspicion came to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not try to win!&#8221; was the suggestion
that flashed to her mind. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t try!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment her brain was in a whirl, and she
had an idea that she ought to tell her chums what
she had in mind. Then she decided to be cautious&mdash;to
wait and watch a little longer. She wanted
to find out his reason.
</p>
<p>Who was this strange young man who seemed
so friendly? What did he want in Bayhead?
Why had he proposed a race? And then, after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
proposing it, why had he not won it when, clearly,
he might have done so?
</p>
<p>These were the questions that Cora asked herself
as she slowed down her motor.
</p>
<p>She had used up her limit of power in an honest
endeavor to win, but the young man had not. He
had held back purposely.
</p>
<p>Why had he done it?

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>ODD TALK</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I couldn&#8217;t beat you!&#8221; called the young
man, waving his hand to the girls in Cora&#8217;s boat.
&#8220;You had more speed than I thought.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it was a fair race?&#8221; asked Cora,
looking at him sharply. Her tone was peculiar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fair race? What do you mean?&#8221; he asked,
wonderingly. &#8220;Do you think I should have given
myself more of a handicap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, blushing
that he should have mistaken her meaning. &#8220;You
were generous&mdash;too generous, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m not complaining. Of
course it was a fair race. The faster boat won.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you think so,&#8221; spoke Cora, meaningly,
as she thought of the partly-closed throttle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes indeed. I&#8217;m satisfied!&#8221; he exclaimed
in generous tones. &#8220;But is the dangerous place
you spoke of near here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right ahead,&#8221; answered Cora, pointing to
where the water was swirling in over some partly-hidden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
rocks. &#8220;Keep well out, and when you
round the point you&#8217;ll be at Bayhead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m greatly obliged to you,&#8221; was his reply.
But Cora did not look at him, nor return his bow.
She swung her boat around and started back for
the bungalow. The young man, with a curious
glance at her, bent over his motor to make some
adjustment. In another instant his craft shot
ahead, seemingly at greater speed than it had
made at any time during the race.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think much of him,&#8221; observed Lottie,
as she took a more comfortable position on the
cushions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Belle asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he didn&#8217;t even invite us to a tennis
game, to say nothing of ice cream sodas, and
there&#8217;s a place in Bayhead where they have the
most delicious chocolate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lottie!&#8221; gasped Marita. &#8220;Would you have
gone with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; with a shrug of her shoulders, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know as I would, only&mdash;he might have asked
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Cora, and the manner
in which she spoke caused her chums to look curiously
at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; inquired Bess,
merely for the sake of argument. She had stopped
eating sweets&mdash;for the time being.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because he had a special object in view in
asking us to race, and once that was accomplished
he had no further use for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Cora Kimball!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;What
makes you say that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I think it. You didn&#8217;t see all that I
did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221; asked Bess, eagerly.
&#8220;Did he have some sort of weapon? Or do you
think he tried to get us over this way, hoping we
would be wrecked on the rocks? Maybe he was
a wrecker, Cora. I&#8217;ve heard that there are some
of those terrible people in this section.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;I only mean
that his boat is a very powerful one. He did not
&#8216;let her out,&#8217; as Jack says, to the limit. He could
easily have beaten us if he had wanted to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that
kind of young man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;Not because he refused
to win when he could, but because of what
may be his object. That he had one I&#8217;m certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls turned to look at the other motor
boat. It was rounding the point to Bayhead now,
and seemed to be going at remarkable speed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How fast it goes!&#8221; exclaimed Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, much faster than the <i>Chelton</i>,&#8221; responded
Cora. &#8220;I told you he was holding back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What could have been his object?&#8221; asked
Belle.
</p>
<p>And that was a question all the girls asked
themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my nerves are better, anyhow,&#8221; observed
Bess, as she threw back the clustering hair
from her face so that the wind might caress her
cheeks, now flushed with excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; spoke Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The antidote of the race and the excitement
of the mystery, as to why the nice young man
didn&#8217;t want to win, are guaranteed to cure nerves
or money refunded,&#8221; said Lottie with a laugh.
&#8220;Where are you going, Cora?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the bungalow, of course. Mrs. Lewis
may be anxious about us. It is nearly lunch time,
anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is time for us to be anxious about ourselves,&#8221;
said Bess. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe Mrs.
Lewis will worry. You know she went away right
after doing up the breakfast things. She said she
was going to consult some friends, for those she
saw last night could not help her, and she may not
be back yet. So there&#8217;s no need to hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have an idea!&#8221; cried Cora. &#8220;We
have our tea outfit with us, and some crackers.
Why not go ashore and have a little picnic? It
will complete the nerve treatment, perhaps,&#8221; and
she smiled at Bess.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried that girl. &#8220;It will be just the
thing. Are you sure you have enough crackers,
Cora? If not we could stop at the store on the
point and get some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there are more than are good for you,&#8221;
was the answer.
</p>
<p>Cora changed the course of the boat to send the
craft over toward a pretty little wooded cove
where the girls had often gone ashore for
luncheon. They always carried in the boat an
alcohol stove, with the necessary ingredients for
tea.
</p>
<p>Soon the <i>Chelton</i> was beached at a place where
the small waves would do her no damage, and the
girls were preparing luncheon.
</p>
<p>They carried their own fresh water with them,
not depending on finding a spring. Condensed
milk, sugar and some tins of sweet crackers completed
the meal, which was served on the grass for
a table, paper napkins adding to the luxury of the
occasion.
</p>
<p>The picnic place was on a spit of land that
jutted out into Crystal Bay. It could be approached
from either side, and on one side there
was some dense shrubbery that hid the water from
sight.
</p>
<p>It was when Cora and her chums were in the
midst of their impromptu luncheon that they heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
a boat grate on the beach that was hidden from
view by the bushes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone is coming!&#8221; exclaimed Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the boys,&#8221; remarked Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time they followed us,&#8221; suggested
Lottie. &#8220;They don&#8217;t give us a moment&#8217;s peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want it?&#8221; asked Cora pointedly, for
Lottie had been rather taken up with Jack, of late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the girl. &#8220;Of
course the boys are nice, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Handsome is as handsome does,&#8217;&#8221; quoted
Belle. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t happen to be the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just had a glimpse of them through the
bushes. It&#8217;s a strange motor boat&mdash;neither the
<i>Dixie</i> nor the <i>Lassie</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is in her?&#8221; asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make out. Listen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She raised her hand for silence, but there was
no need. The girls ceased chatting at once, and
silently followed Cora toward a hedge of underbrush,
some little distance from where their luncheon
was spread.
</p>
<p>Then they heard some odd talk&mdash;at least it
seemed odd until they understood the meaning of
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you had a race with them?&#8221; one voice
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied another, who had just landed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
on the spit of the land. &#8220;I raced &#8217;em, but I didn&#8217;t
beat &#8217;em!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I? Say, you know what the <i>Pickerel</i>
can do when she&#8217;s pushed to it. I held back the
throttle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora started. Her suspicions were unexpectedly
confirmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see them from over here,&#8221; whispered
Belle, pulling Cora&#8217;s sleeve. Cora moved to
where an opening in the bushes afforded a glimpse
of the strangers.
</p>
<p>She saw three men, and one of them she knew
in an instant to be the young chap who had raced
with her. His boat, too, was on the beach. It
was from her that the men had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know how fast the <i>Chelton</i> can go
now, that&#8217;s sure,&#8221; spoke a voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the young man, &#8220;I know.
We needn&#8217;t fear her if it comes to a chase. That&#8217;s
what I wanted to make sure of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then all we have to do is to get the rest of
the evidence, and the property is ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We can turn the widow and the daughter
out, all right, if we get the necessary papers.
Then we can go ahead and build the dam across
the brook.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to arouse a lot of opposition!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
exclaimed the third member of the trio. &#8220;It will
spoil the park.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t help it. We need the dam for
power for our factory, and the people don&#8217;t really
need the park. We&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean we&#8217;ll make Shane do it!&#8221; exclaimed
the young man who had raced with Cora.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE NIGHT PLOT</h3>
</div>

<p>The girls looked at one another with startled
glances. Cora bent forward eagerly in order to
better hear what else was said. She had no compunctions
as to eavesdropping, feeling that it was
justified under the circumstances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must mean Denny Shane, the old fisherman,&#8221;
whispered Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned Cora. Not only did she
want to listen, but she was fearful lest the men on
the other side of the hedge discover the presence
of herself and her chums.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; resumed the speaker, &#8220;we must make
old Shane do it. Once we get him in the proper
frame of mind he&#8217;ll testify just as we want him to.
And we need some testimony to offset that of the
widow and her girl. Otherwise we&#8217;ll never get
the property without a long delay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can we get Shane in the proper frame
of mind to testify as we want him to?&#8221; asked
another of the trio.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Leave that to me,&#8221; answered the one who had
been in the fast motor boat. And Cora started as
she noted the difference in his tone now. It was
hard and cruel, while, in speaking to her, his accents
had been those of a cultured gentleman, used
to polite society. There was a metallic ring to his
voice now that boded no good to Denny Shane.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess we&#8217;ll leave it to you, Bruce,&#8221; said
a voice, &#8220;though maybe Kelly could put it over
him with a bit of blarney. You know Shane is
Irish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! No names, and not so loud!&#8221;
cautioned the one who had been addressed as
Bruce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d be listening?&#8221; asked the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell, Moran,&#8221; was the retort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go!&#8221; exclaimed Bruce, fretfully,
and the girls knew it must have been the one
called Kelly who spoke that time.
</p>
<p>There was a movement on the other side of
the bush, and Cora, with a sudden motion,
crouched down, signalling the others to do the
same. It was only just in time, too. Fortunately
for the girls they were in a sort of depression, and
by crouching down they got out of sight, as one of
the men came forward to peer through the underbrush.
He saw nothing, as was evidenced by his
report a moment later.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a soul here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
been some picnic party around, but they&#8217;ve gone.
It&#8217;s as deserted as a graveyard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we came away from our luncheon,&#8221;
whispered Cora, as the men resumed their talk.
The wind sprang up, for a moment, and carried
their tones away from the girls, so that only an
indistinct murmur could be heard. Then there
came clear talk again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the program, then?&#8221; asked one
whom the girls could tell was Moran. He was
the same man they had seen before in the drug
store.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get at Shane first of all,&#8221; decided Kelly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to let Bruce do it, even if I am Irish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all have to call on him,&#8221; said Bruce,
grimly, &#8220;but only one need actually do the business.
We&#8217;ve got to deal with him in two ways.
We&#8217;ve got to make him tell what we want brought
out in court, and we&#8217;ve got to scare him so that
he won&#8217;t tell what we don&#8217;t want known. And
there are two ways of doing that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Kelly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First we can offer him a reward. It will be
worth it, even if we have to pay something to have
him testify as we wish. The committee allowed
us a certain sum for&mdash;well, let us say for witness
fees. I&#8217;d rather pay him a hundred dollars and
have it all over with. It&#8217;s better to have a friend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
than an enemy, and you never can tell which way
a thing like this is going to swing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sposin&#8217; he won&#8217;t take the cash?&#8221; asked
Moran.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have another plan,&#8221; and Bruce laughed
bitterly. &#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t need to say what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wise,&#8221; remarked Kelly. &#8220;Only&mdash;not too
rough, you understand. He&#8217;s a feeble old man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No rougher than&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; agreed Bruce.
</p>
<p>Cora clasped her hands, and looked with fear
in her eyes at her chums.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;&mdash;we mustn&#8217;t let them harm dear old
Denny!&#8221; whispered Belle, shivering with nervousness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned Cora. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk&mdash;think!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a movement on the other side of the
screen of bushes, as indicating that the men were
about to leave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll let it go until to-night then,&#8221; said
Kelly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Until to-night,&#8221; agreed Bruce. &#8220;And we
know, in case of a slip-up, that there&#8217;s no motor
boat around here that can catch us when we make
our get-away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the <i>Dixie</i>,&#8221; suggested Moran.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s out of commission, I heard,&#8221; responded
Bruce. &#8220;And she won&#8217;t be in shape for a day or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
so. The <i>Chelton</i>&mdash;well, I gave her a try-out a
while ago, and I know what she can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do you?&#8221; thought Cora. &#8220;Perhaps you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to laugh when I think how I took those
girls in,&#8221; went on Bruce. &#8220;I pretending that I was
a stranger in these waters, and they kindly offering
to pilot me. I guess they took me for some society
swell of Bayhead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The mean thing!&#8221; hissed Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can do the society act when you
have to,&#8221; said Kelly. &#8220;Only I guess we won&#8217;t
need that now. Shane doesn&#8217;t move in society circles.
How&#8217;d the game with the widow&#8217;s daughter
work out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t work at all. &#8216;Confidence Kate&#8217; didn&#8217;t
gain her confidence. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m switching to
Shane,&#8221; answered Bruce. &#8220;But we&#8217;d better be
going. There&#8217;s lots to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and the motor girls listened in silence as
the men crunched their way down the beach to
their boat.
</p>
<p>A little later they were chugging away in the
speedy <i>Pickerel</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just awful!&#8221; gasped Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a villainous plot!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m so nervous! I know I&#8217;m going to cry&mdash;or
laugh&mdash;or do both.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bess Robinson, if you do anything foolish, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
faint, you shan&#8217;t do a thing toward helping to save
Denny Shane!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, vigorously.
&#8220;And I know you do want to help him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do. I&#8217;ll behave. Oh, let me have
a cup of tea.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll all be better for it,&#8221; assented
Cora. &#8220;Come, girls, let&#8217;s eat and then we&#8217;ll get
back. We, too, have a great deal to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you girls are going to try
to&mdash;&mdash;to outwit those desperate men?&#8221; asked
Marita, her eyes opened wide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly do mean to!&#8221; insisted Cora.
&#8220;Who else would do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only constables in a place like this.
We can do better than they&mdash;especially with the
boys to help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, the boys!&#8221; agreed Marita, and
she seemed relieved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say it was most providential that we
heard what they said,&#8221; spoke Lottie, looking to
see if there were any grass stains on her dress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it was,&#8221; assented Cora.
</p>
<p>It was rather an excited little luncheon, but the
hot tea did them all good, and then, rapidly talking
over what they had just gone through, and making
all sorts of plans to outwit the schemers, the girls
got into their boat again, and headed for the
bungalow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we must warn Denny at once,&#8221;
said Cora, and to this the girls agreed. &#8220;Then
we&#8217;ll tell the boys, and see what they suggest.
But I almost know what Jack will say!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Lottie. She was very much
interested in Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll want to hide and capture the villains
&#8216;red-handed,&#8217; as he calls it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t know but what that&#8217;s as good a
plan as any,&#8221; remarked Belle. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see
them do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and her chums found Mrs. Lewis rather
worried over their absence from the bungalow.
She had returned, unsuccessful, from seeing her
friends. Freda was recovering from the shock
and fright of the day before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; Mrs. Lewis asked
Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just off on a little picnic,&#8221; was the answer,
and Cora motioned to her chums to say nothing
of what they had heard. They had agreed that it
would be better for the widow not to know, at
least for the present.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner will be ready soon,&#8221; suggested Mrs.
Lewis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have it a little late to-day,&#8221; replied
Cora. &#8220;We have had some tea, and I want to
go over and see Jack. They haven&#8217;t been around
here since we left; have they?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered Freda. &#8220;They were all
here, wanting to know where you&#8217;d gone; but of
course I couldn&#8217;t say. Then they went out in your
brother&#8217;s boat, but they didn&#8217;t get far before they
had a breakdown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the <i>Lassie</i>&#8217;s day off again,&#8221; laughed Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they take the <i>Dixie</i>?&#8221; asked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is the matter with her, too,&#8221; replied
Freda.
</p>
<p>Cora and her chums exchanged meaning glances.
The talk of the men was confirmed. Evidently
they had their own way of getting information.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll go over to Camp Couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; suggested
Cora, after a pause. &#8220;They&#8217;re probably
there now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found the boys grouped about, in and out
of the tent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been lonesome for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How bright the day seems now, to what it was
before!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus chanted Jack, Walter, Ed and Dray Ward,
as they saw the advancing girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop that nonsense, Jack!&#8221; exclaimed
Cora, as her brother waltzed forward to do a
two-step on the moss with timid Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots!&#8221; she exclaimed, and her manner must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
have impressed Jack, for he grew grave at once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has anything more happened since last
night?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There has. We&#8217;ve discovered the meanest
plot to harm Denny Shane. Listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We list!&#8221; recited Walter, but Cora quieted
him with a look.
</p>
<p>Then began the telling of the overheard conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The nerve of that chap wanting a race!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll race <i>him</i>, all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And so they&#8217;re going to do up old Denny,
eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;ll have a hand in that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>These were the comments of Jack and his
chums.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t do anything rash,&#8221; begged Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do <i>something</i>,&#8221; insisted Jack.
</p>
<p>After some consultation it was agreed that the
boys should go over and have a talk with the fisherman,
and then, among themselves, they would
decide on what was best to be done.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the girls would go back to the
bungalow, there to await the report of the boys.
Nothing would be said to Mrs. Lewis, for she had
had alarm enough.
</p>
<p>It was anxious waiting for the girls, and they
were so nervous that they did not enjoy the dinner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Mrs. Lewis had prepared, at which lack of appetite
she wondered much. But she ascribed their
distraction, and their rather strange comments, to
the alarm of the day before.
</p>
<p>Finally the <i>Lassie</i>, which had somehow been induced
to &#8220;mote,&#8221; was descried coming across the
bay from the direction of the old fisherman&#8217;s cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, girls!&#8221; called Cora as she saw the
boys. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go down and meet them.&#8221; She did
not want Mrs. Lewis to hear the talk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack?&#8221; asked Cora, as the boat came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not well&mdash;bad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Denny wasn&#8217;t at
home, and no one knew where he had gone. So
we left a note for him, and we&#8217;ll be on hand to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about us?&#8221; asked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stay here,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;No telling
what sort of a row we may run into, and you&#8217;re
better at home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; agreed Cora, but the look
she gave her chums had more meaning in it than
the mere words indicated. Bess and the others
understood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; went on Jack, &#8220;we&#8217;ll proceed to
find out why the <i>Dixie</i> won&#8217;t mote. We want her
in shape to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Dray. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s
the carbureter. I&#8217;ll get a man from the garage to
look it over.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll want a fast boat if the one those fellows
have is as speedy as you girls say,&#8221; remarked
Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we take the <i>Chelton</i>?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Pickerel</i> beat us to-day,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;Besides,
it might be good to have her in reserve.
Try and have the <i>Dixie</i> fixed up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will!&#8221; promised her owner.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the day seemed like a dream
to the girls. Never had time passed so slowly.
They were waiting for what the night might bring.
</p>
<p>The boys made several other trips to the fisherman&#8217;s
cabin, going afoot through the woods, as
the <i>Lassie</i> had again gone on a strike, and a man
from the garage was working over the <i>Dixie</i>.
</p>
<p>The fisherman&#8217;s cabin could be reached in two
ways, but the water route was preferred by the
young people, even though it was longer.
</p>
<p>The boys could not find Denny at home, however,
and planned to be at his cabin just at dusk,
and to remain there until something happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ll be sure to be there when the men
arrive,&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>Finally twilight came, and with the falling of
night the repairs to the <i>Dixie</i> were completed.
She seemed to be running better than in some time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here we go!&#8221; remarked Walter, as the
boys took their places in the swift craft. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
let you girls know what happens&mdash;as soon as it
happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better!&#8221; laughed Cora. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
very anxious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She and her chums had come down to the dock
to see the boys leave on their trip to save Denny
from an unknown danger.
</p>
<p>Then came more anxious waiting.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE BREAKDOWN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, he hasn&#8217;t come back yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s sort of queer, too. I wonder where
he can be keeping himself, all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe those fellows have got to him after
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack Kimball and his chums, landing at the
fisherman&#8217;s dock from the <i>Dixie</i>, thus commented
when they paid another visit to Denny&#8217;s cabin, and
found him still absent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t imagine anything has happened,&#8221;
said Jack. &#8220;You know he often goes off and stays
a long time in his boat. He&#8217;s got a crazy sort of
motor in it, that runs about as often as the one
does in the <i>Lassie</i>. He may be stuck somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else waiting the turn of the tide,&#8221; suggested
Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; chimed in Dray. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
him say that certain fish won&#8217;t bite when the tide&#8217;s
running out, and that you can catch others only
when it&#8217;s coming in. Maybe he is hanging around
for that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then he ought to be back soon,&#8221; declared
Jack, &#8220;for the tide turned a half-hour ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s far out in the bay it will take him a
long while to come in. His boat doesn&#8217;t make
very good time,&#8221; observed Walter.
</p>
<p>The boys walked around the cabin. It was
closed and locked, and the warning note they had
left for the fisherman was still pinned to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which shows that those men haven&#8217;t been
here,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;That makes me fear that they
may have gotten to him before us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s evident that the men haven&#8217;t been
here since the girls gave us the alarm. If they
had they&#8217;d have torn up that note. Then, too,
you&#8217;d think, if they were going to try to make
Denny do what they wanted in the way of giving
testimony, they&#8217;d be getting at it. He goes to bed
early, as everybody around here knows, and locks
up. If those fellows wanted to get at him without
breaking in they&#8217;d come early. All of which
makes me think that they may already have had
a serious interview with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; observed Walter. &#8220;I&#8217;m more inclined
to believe that he&#8217;s out on the bay somewhere.
If he is he&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows, I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221; cried Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold fast to it&mdash;they&#8217;re scarce,&#8221; remarked
Ed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, but seriously. Suppose we cruise about a
bit. We needn&#8217;t go far from the shore, and we
can have an eye on the cabin. In case Denny is out
on the water we may pick him up. Then we could
tell him what was on, and warn him. We could
do it even better than on shore here, for there&#8217;s
no telling but what some of those fellows may be in
hiding around here,&#8221; and Jack cast a look about.
It was dark, but a full moon was coming up to
make a light that revealed most objects.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if there is a possibility that someone
may be in ambush here,&#8221; said Walter, &#8220;we&#8217;d better
keep a bit more mum. But I think Jack&#8217;s plan is a
good one. Let&#8217;s cruise about a bit, but keep
within sight of the cabin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No one had any objections so, after making a
casual search about the cabin, and not finding anyone
in hiding, the boys again got aboard the <i>Dixie</i>
and started to cruise on the bay, that was now
sparkling in the moonlight.
</p>
<p>Jack and his chums kept a careful watch for
Denny Shane&#8217;s boat. There were several motor
craft out, for the night was one that invited trips
on the water&mdash;calm and still, with a gentle breeze
that had in it the tang of salt mingled with the
sweet odors of Summer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel just like singing,&#8221; remarked Ed, after a
pause during which the <i>Dixie</i> cruised about, not
too far from the cabin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have some regard for our feelings,&#8221; begged
Jack. &#8220;Remember that we are under a great
strain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Ed would be, too, if he sang,&#8221; said Walter.
&#8220;At least I would feel constrained to remonstrate
with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Think no one can sing but yourself!&#8221;
retorted Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Moonlight always did have a queer effect on
him,&#8221; remarked Jack.
</p>
<p>Round about they cruised, and they were thinking
of returning to make sure that Denny had not
reached his cabin by some other route, unseen by
them, when the motor of the <i>Dixie</i> gave a combined
cough, groan and sneeze, and stopped short.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There she goes!&#8221; exclaimed Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean there she <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> go!&#8221; corrected
Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the talcum powder,&#8221; suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Dray didn&#8217;t use the tooth brush on
her before we came out,&#8221; spoke Jack, accusingly.
</p>
<p>The boys had a way of doing the most absurd
things, from a mechanical standpoint, whenever
their motors refused to mote. They would dust
talcum powder on the cylinder tops, or tie a piece
of baby-blue ribbon on the pet-cock when they had
exhausted every other means of making a rebellious
motor operate.
</p>
<p>And the odd part of it was that, often, when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
they had done these seemingly silly things, the boat
would start. So they were rather superstitious
about it, and they did carry a tin of talcum powder
with them, much to the amusement of the girls.
</p>
<p>In turn the usual sources of trouble were
looked for and eliminated one after the other.
</p>
<p>No wires seemed to have broken, the current
was good, the vibrator buzzed when the contact
was made and there was plenty of gasoline in the
tank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put in a new spark plug,&#8221; suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;New ones went in to-day,&#8221; answered Dray.
&#8220;They can&#8217;t have sooted already. It isn&#8217;t there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her a little more air,&#8221; proposed Walter.
&#8220;I think she&#8217;s getting too rich a gasoline mixture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to touch the carbureter!&#8221; declared
the young owner of the <i>Dixie</i>. &#8220;It was
trouble enough to get her fixed before. Hand me
that talcum.&#8221; Gravely he dusted some on the
pump rod.
</p>
<p>Then another attempt was made to start the
motor, but it only sighed dismally, and refused to
do its duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; cried Jack, looking up from where he
had been examining the carbureter with an electrical
pocket flash, &#8220;we&#8217;re drifting out to sea!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are!&#8221; agreed Ed. &#8220;Say, can&#8217;t you get
her going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t seem to,&#8221; replied Drayton. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
this boat and get another as soon as I can. She&#8217;s
a nuisance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we sure are broken down,&#8221; sighed Jack,
&#8220;and how we are going to get back to the cabin
is more than I can figure out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s whistle for help,&#8221; suggested Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, pointing in the direction
of shore. &#8220;There&#8217;s a light in Denny&#8217;s
cabin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They all looked, and saw a flickering gleam of
fire near the shack that had been deserted all day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s doing!&#8221; cried Ed. &#8220;And we&#8217;re
stuck out here!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AT THE CABIN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; declared Cora Kimball, &#8220;I can&#8217;t
stand it any longer! I&#8217;ve got to do something&mdash;or
have nervous prostration.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just the way I feel!&#8221; said Bess.
&#8220;Waiting is the most nervous thing in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have another chocolate,&#8221; suggested Lottie,
helping herself from the box on a table near her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you suggest such a thing?&#8221; demanded
Bess. &#8220;As if I wasn&#8217;t trying to do all I
could to reduce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I was thinking of your nerves,&#8221; observed
Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it you want to do, Cora, dear?&#8221;
asked Marita.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go to Denny&#8217;s cabin, and see what
has happened,&#8221; was the answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Belle, with an exclamation of
surprise and alarm. &#8220;Tramp through the woods
at this hour of night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t any such great, or late, hour of night,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
replied Cora, calmly, &#8220;and the woods are not
dark. There&#8217;s a lovely moon. But I don&#8217;t propose
to go through the woods. What is the <i>Chelton</i>
for if we can&#8217;t use her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball, do you mean to say that you&#8217;d
go out on the bay, and over to Denny&#8217;s cabin, after
dark, with the prospect that some desperate men
are going to attack him?&#8221; asked Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys are going to be there,&#8221; answered
Cora, still refusing to become excited. &#8220;Besides,
they may need our help. We could take a prisoner
or two in our boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a chorus of screams.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball&mdash;how dare you?&#8221; demanded
Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I meant if he was tied hand and foot,&#8221;
went on the leader of the motor girls. &#8220;Villains
are always tied hand and foot, you know. They
can&#8217;t move. They&#8217;re gagged, too. I think I should
insist on having our villain gagged. It might happen
to be that young man who raced with us to-day,
and he might get sarcastic if he could talk.
Yes, I think he must be gagged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cora, you&#8217;re hopeless,&#8221; sighed Lottie.
&#8220;What would my mother say if she could see me
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d tell you to stop eating chocolates and
come with me,&#8221; returned Cora, firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to the cabin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; volunteered Marita, and
then she blushed at the attention she attracted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if Marita isn&#8217;t afraid to go, I&#8217;m not,&#8221;
announced Lottie, with spirit. &#8220;Come on, Cora.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; echoed Belle. &#8220;Do we have to
stay here all alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Either that, or come with us,&#8221; invited Cora.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to the cabin in our boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a step at the door of the living room,
and Mrs. Lewis looked in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I hear you girls say you were going out?&#8221;
she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just for a little trip on the water,&#8221; replied
Cora, signing to her chums to keep silent. &#8220;It is
so lovely with the moon, and we won&#8217;t go far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a great way to Denny&#8217;s cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t be gone too long,&#8221; cautioned the
widow. &#8220;You must remember that I am, in a
way, responsible for you girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll be careful,&#8221; Cora promised. &#8220;We&#8217;d
take Freda with us, but perhaps she had better
stay with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so. Besides, she is so nervous
after what nearly happened last night, that I&#8217;d
rather she wouldn&#8217;t go out. Oh, if only things
were settled! If only we were sure we could get
that property back, and not have to worry about it
being taken away from us!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have they been annoying you of late?&#8221; asked
Cora, thinking perhaps there had been some developments
of which she was unaware.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing special, since that horrid woman.
But it is a constant worry to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; returned Cora, sympathetically.
&#8220;Well, we will hope for the best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora did not say so&mdash;even to her chums, but she
had great hopes that something might develop
from the events of this night. If the unscrupulous
men could only be caught in some wrong-doing a
hold might be obtained over them that would enable
them to be defeated in court. Thus their
claim to the property&mdash;which claim Cora felt sure
was a false one&mdash;might be disproved.
</p>
<p>That there were papers in existence which
would show the widow and her daughter to be
the rightful owners Cora did not doubt. Freda&#8217;s
grandfather, from all accounts, was a careful business
man, if eccentric in some ways. He would
not have come into possession of property without
having the papers to prove his claim. And he was
not a man to put them in some safe deposit vault
and leave no memorandum as to finding the key.
</p>
<p>Perhaps they were concealed in some nook or
cranny in the widow&#8217;s home. Cora made up her
mind to have a search made after this night was
over.
</p>
<p>Then, too, Denny might be able to come upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
them. Eccentric in some ways, as Freda&#8217;s grandfather
had been, he might have hidden the papers
in Denny&#8217;s cabin.
</p>
<p>That was a new thought. Perhaps the scheming
men knew this, and that is why they wanted
to attack the old fisherman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We simply must go to his cabin,&#8221; decided
Cora, &#8220;and find out what has happened. I can&#8217;t
wait any longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wraps were quickly donned, and down to the
dock went the girls. The <i>Chelton</i> was in running
order, and soon they were out on the moonlit
waters of the bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a light in his cabin,&#8221; said Cora, as
they came out from behind a point, and had a view
of the little cove where nestled Denny&#8217;s cottage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the boys are there,&#8221; remarked Bess,
&#8220;and that they have the villains all tied up and
ready for delivery.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;If they have I
wish they&#8217;d send them by parcel post instead of
asking us to take charge of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be harmless,&#8221; guaranteed Cora. &#8220;Besides,
the <i>Dixie</i> can&#8217;t hold more than the boys;
our boat is larger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could let the boys run this one, after the
men are tied in her,&#8221; suggested Lottie, &#8220;and we
could come home in the <i>Dixie</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; exclaimed Cora. &#8220;You can&#8217;t rely on
her. I&#8217;ll stick to the <i>Chelton</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But if the girls had only known that, at that
moment, far out on Crystal Bay, was the ill-fated
<i>Dixie</i>, drifting to sea, while the boys tooted hopelessly
for aid on the compressed air whistles!
</p>
<p>The <i>Chelton</i> made a quick and uneventful trip
to the fisherman&#8217;s cabin. From it a light peacefully
glowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one here,&#8221; announced Bess. &#8220;Not
even the boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful,&#8221; warned Cora. &#8220;It may be a
trap. Let us go up softly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about those men?&#8221; asked Belle.
&#8220;Maybe they have taken Denny away with them,
and the boys, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; advised Cora. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up
and look in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they peered in the cabin window they saw
Denny seated in an easy chair. He was alone, and
across his knees was the red oar of which he
seemed so fond.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>UNEXPECTED HELP</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, we certainly are up against it&mdash;good
and proper!&#8221; exclaimed Jack. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad the
girls aren&#8217;t along!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Walter, leaning back against
the gunwale to rest after laboring over the refractory
engine of the <i>Dixie</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they can&#8217;t call me down for my slang.
And believe muh&mdash;as the telephone girls say&mdash;I
can use slang now and then&mdash;some!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is aggravating; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aggravating, my dear chap, is hardly the
word,&#8221; drawled Ed. &#8220;It&#8217;s humiliating!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He brought that out in such a droll way that the
others laughed.
</p>
<p>For the engine of the motor boat still refused
to be coaxed into going. They were being carried
out toward the mouth of the bay on the outgoing
tide, which was now running strongly. Soon they
would be out to sea, and though the moon still
shone brightly there was a haze in the sky that betokened
a coming storm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>But it was not so much the fact of the stalled
engine, nor that they were being carried out to sea,
and were in some danger, that worried the boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re falling down on what we said we&#8217;d
do,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;We promised the girls that
we&#8217;d save Denny from those fellows, and we can&#8217;t
do it. They may be at him now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly saw a light at his cabin,&#8221; ventured
Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t see it now,&#8221; added Jack, straining
his eyes for a glimpse of the spot where the fisherman&#8217;s
shack stood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no use worrying over what can&#8217;t
be helped,&#8221; observed Walter, philosophically.
&#8220;We&#8217;re here and not there. Denny will have to
look out for himself&mdash;I guess he&#8217;s able.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the point,&#8221; rejoined Jack. &#8220;There
we took the case out of the girls&#8217; hands, so to
speak. We said we were the big noise, and that
we&#8217;d look after things. Then we go and get stuck
miles from shore where we can&#8217;t do a thing.
They&#8217;ll laugh at us when we do get back, if they
don&#8217;t do any worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t know we were going to get
stuck when we came out for a little run, after we
found Denny wasn&#8217;t home,&#8221; said Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no excuse,&#8221; returned Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s like
a child breaking the looking glass and then saying
he didn&#8217;t mean to. Well, I know one thing Cora
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
will say when we get back&mdash;if we ever do&mdash;and
own up that we weren&#8217;t on hand when the play
came off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What will she say?&#8221; asked Dray. He was
not well acquainted with the doings and sayings of
the motor girls, as yet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll say that she and Bess and Belle and the
rest of them could have done better themselves, if
we&#8217;d left it to them. And I guess she&#8217;d be more
than half right,&#8221; sighed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s no use crying over a bridge before
you come to it,&#8221; observed Dray. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
have another go at that engine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They began their labors all over again. They
even took out the spark plugs, though they had
been new that afternoon.
</p>
<p>Nothing could be found wrong there. The feed
pipe from the gasoline tank was examined, but it
seemed to provide a good flow. The timer was
adjusted and readjusted. The coil was looked to.
Everything, in short, that the boys could think of,
or that previous trouble had taught them to look
for, was tried, and all with no effect.
</p>
<p>They even did more absurd things, such as the
talcum powder act, while Jack spouted some Latin
verses at the forward cylinder. But the motor
refused to mote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, all the while, we&#8217;re going out to sea,&#8221;
remarked Walter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Out to sea to see what we can see,&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush-a-bye-baby on the jokes,&#8221; exclaimed
Dray, a bit petulantly. &#8220;If ever I buy a speed
boat again you&#8217;ll know it! A good old-fashioned
make-and-break motor for mine after this&mdash;one
you can depend on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you an oar or a paddle?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing that we could use to work against
the tide,&#8221; answered Dray, gloomily. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
boat hook, but that isn&#8217;t any better than a straw.
I left the oars out after the man got through fixing
the motor to-day. He said I wouldn&#8217;t need them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The regard that individual has for the truth
is something scandalous!&#8221; said Walter, grimly.
&#8220;I shall acquaint him with the fact on my return.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When we <i>do</i> return,&#8221; returned Jack, gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re bound to be picked up&mdash;sooner or
later,&#8221; declared Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly later,&#8221; went on Jack, more gloomily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here goes for another try,&#8221; said Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Maybe the machine has just
been giving us a try-out,&#8221; suggested Ed. &#8220;We
certainly have said mean things about you, old
Mote!&#8221; he went on sarcastically. &#8220;Kindly forgive
us and go. &#8216;See by moonlight &#8217;tis &#8217;most midnight,
time boat and us were home hour-and-a-half
ago,&#8217;&#8221; he said, quoting from the old nursery
rhyme.
</p>
<p>But the motor only coughed and sighed and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
wheezed like an old man with the asthma, and
the boat still drifted.
</p>
<p>They called, they blew on the compressed air
whistle until all the reserve supply of oxygen was
exhausted from the tank, and then they had to
resort to their voices again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one thing left,&#8221; answered Jack,
tragically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; begged Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can swim for it. That&#8217;s better than being
carried out to sea. Let&#8217;s swim before it is too
late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say!&#8221; exclaimed Dray. &#8220;Let
the <i>Dixie</i> go&mdash;she&#8217;s no good!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others were considering Jack&#8217;s startling
proposal, when Ed looked up, and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark! Don&#8217;t you hear something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others listened. Faintly from the direction
of the sea came a sound&mdash;unmistakable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A boat!&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not take off my
coat yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A motor boat, too,&#8221; added Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And coming this way,&#8221; went on Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows, give &#8217;em a hail!&#8221; suggested
Dray.
</p>
<p>Up to now, with all their shouting and blowing
of the whistle, they had neither seen nor heard of
a craft. They had drifted too far out. If any
had come within hearing distance the occupants
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
had paid no heed to the calls for help. Now
there was one approaching, that was evident.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All together, now!&#8221; called Jack, and they
united their voices in a shout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are her lights!&#8221; called Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and she&#8217;s heading right over here,&#8221;
agreed Ed.
</p>
<p>A little later the red and green lights came
nearer.
</p>
<p>Then, as the craft surged up to the stalled
Dixie, and came to a stop, the engine still running
with the clutch thrown out, a voice asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you fellows want a tow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we?&#8221; came in a chorus. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want
anything any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fling us your rope,&#8221; was the curt order.
</p>
<p>Unexpected help had arrived. But it was too
late.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>DENNY&#8217;S SOLILOQUY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Cora, in a
whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> rather a puzzle,&#8221; admitted Bess.
</p>
<p>The motor girls were standing outside Denny
Shane&#8217;s cabin, looking in on him as he sat at his
ease, with the red oar over his knees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to be in any danger,&#8221; went
on Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, those men either haven&#8217;t harmed him, or
they haven&#8217;t arrived yet,&#8221; returned Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but suppose they should come while we
are here?&#8221; suggested Marita, shrinking against
Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go to supposing such uncanny things,&#8221;
objected Cora, as she put her arm about the other.
&#8220;Are you afraid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the hesitating answer. &#8220;I
suppose one ought to be afraid, coming at night
to a cabin where some horrible men are expected.
And yet, somehow, I don&#8217;t seem to be,&#8221; replied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Marita. &#8220;I know I would have been a few
months ago, but since I have met you girls, and
seen the things you do, why it&#8217;s queer, but really
I&mdash;I rather like it!&#8221; and she laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See what your influence has done,&#8221; whispered
Cora.
</p>
<p>They had all spoken in low tones, for Denny
was sometimes sharp of hearing, and they did not
want to arouse him.
</p>
<p>The girls were really puzzled, not only at the
peaceful surroundings at Denny&#8217;s cabin, but at the
absence of the boys. Of course they could not
know that Jack and the others had been there and
gone, not finding Denny at home. Nor did they
know anything of the note left pinned to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose it could all be over?&#8221; asked
Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All over? What do you mean?&#8221; asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean could the men have been here, and
been captured by the boys and taken to jail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s possible, but not very probable,&#8221; returned
Cora. &#8220;They surely would have managed
to get some word to us if anything like that had
happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are we going to do?&#8221; asked Bess.
&#8220;We ought not to stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; admitted Cora, slowly.
&#8220;It might be a good thing, though, just to stop
and speak to Denny. Then we&#8217;d know, soon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
enough, what had happened. Suppose we do
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others agreed. They had stepped away
from the window for a moment, but now Cora
walked toward it again. Denny was still holding
the oar, but he must have gotten up, for the window
was now partly open, and it had not been so
at first.
</p>
<p>Denny was talking to himself. He was indulging
in a soliloquy, apparently addressing himself
to the oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could only talk,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you could
only talk, what a tale you could tell. Yes, indeed!&#8221;
and he sighed. &#8220;A tale of the sea and the land&mdash;of
calm and storms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very poetical; isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; whispered Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; cautioned Cora. &#8220;Listen to what he
says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Denny was evidently in a talking mood, and
was living the past over again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If only Grandfather Lewis were here, what
tales he could tell, too,&#8221; Denny went on. &#8220;And
there&#8217;s one tale I&#8217;d be glad to listen to. He could
tell where the land papers were. If only I could
find &#8217;em everything would be all right, and the
factory men&mdash;ha! we could laugh in our sleeves
at &#8217;em. Laugh in our sleeves! Ha! Ha! No,
we could laugh in their faces, so we could; couldn&#8217;t
we?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>He held up the oar, speaking to it as one might
to a favorite dog.
</p>
<p>Denny swung it above his head, as though testing
its weight as a club.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas so he swung it the night of the storm&mdash;the
night he saved my life!&#8221; murmured Denny.
&#8220;My, what a night that was! What a night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seemed lost in recollection for a moment,
and then resumed his self-communion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas so he held it&mdash;held it out to me in the
smother of foam and spray when I was goin&#8217; under.
And what was it he said?
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grab holt!&#8217; says he. &#8216;Grab holt and I&#8217;ll pull
you in. Don&#8217;t be afraid, the oar is strong!&#8217; And
so it is&mdash;a grand, strong oar. As strong as old
Len Lewis himself. What a grand old man he
was! A fine old man!
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s gone, and we all have to go. I&#8217;ll
have to go with the rest, I suppose. But before I
do go I wish I could find them land papers. What
in the world did Grandfather Lewis do with &#8217;em
anyhow?
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be around here. He ought to have
kept &#8217;em in the bank, or in a strong box; but he
was always like that. Hidin&#8217; his things away in
curious places. He even did it with his tobaccy.
A strange man!
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll wager the papers aren&#8217;t far from the
land. That would be his way&mdash;to keep the papers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
near the land. &#8216;A place for everything and everything
in its place,&#8217; he used to say. What more
natural than that he&#8217;d have the papers near the
land?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder, though, did he stick &#8217;em anywhere
around me cabin? He come over here often
enough to sit and chat. Ah, many&#8217;s the good old
talk we used to have&mdash;a talk of the old days.
Often I&#8217;d come in from me boat, and find him
here. He might have brought the papers an&#8217; hid
&#8217;em here when I was out. I wonder if he did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Denny looked around his simple cabin. He
laid the oar down gently, as a thing revered. He
walked about the room, looking in various places.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the papers wouldn&#8217;t be here,&#8221; he mused.
&#8220;I&#8217;d have found them before this. And those
fellows, who came and upset my place when I
wasn&#8217;t home&mdash;they&#8217;d have found &#8217;em if they was
here. I wonder what Grandfather Lewis did with
them papers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a puzzle that others than Denny Shane
would have given much to solve.
</p>
<p>Cora and her chums looked at one another in
the moonlight outside Denny&#8217;s cabin. His talk
had revealed something to them, but there was no
clue to the missing papers which could prove the
title of Mrs. Lewis to the valuable land.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one thing sure, Denny hasn&#8217;t
been attacked as yet,&#8221; whispered Bess. &#8220;And the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
boys haven&#8217;t been here to warn him, or he&#8217;d show
some signs of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Cora. &#8220;What
had we better do? Tell him ourselves?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say&mdash;let&#8217;s warn him,&#8221; suggested
Belle.
</p>
<p>The girls started for the cabin door, but paused
midway as they heard the approach of a motor
boat near the fisherman&#8217;s little dock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; suggested Cora. &#8220;That may be the
boys now.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE PLOTTERS ARRIVE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; asked one of the four
men in the boat that had come to the rescue of
Jack and his chums. &#8220;Engine broken, or are you
out of gasoline?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got gas, but there may be water in it,&#8221;
replied Dray. &#8220;I watched the fellow when he
filled the tank, though, and he used the chamois
all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t always go by that,&#8221; said another of
the accommodating strangers. &#8220;There&#8217;s an awful
sight of poor gasoline being palmed off nowadays.
Have you got a long rope?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure have,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;It&#8217;s mighty
good of you to stop and give us a tow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed one of the men.
&#8220;We never can tell when we might want a helping
hand ourselves. Pass us the rope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was flung over. The two boats were now
bobbing side by side, for they were well out in the
bay, and the sea was quite choppy. The tide was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
running out, and help had come to the boys not
any too soon.
</p>
<p>The rope, passing from the bow of the <i>Dixie</i>,
where it was made fast to a ring bolt in the deck,
was caught on to a cleat in the stern of the other
boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll look after the steering; will you?&#8221;
asked one of the men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; answered Dray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because there&#8217;s nothing harder than towing a
boat that yaws from side to side,&#8221; the man went
on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep a straight course,&#8221; declared the
owner of the speedy boat that had proved such a
disappointment of late. &#8220;We know something
about gasoline craft.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it,&#8221; remarked one of the occupants
of the rescuing boat, in a grumbling sort of
voice. &#8220;There&#8217;s so many launched on the bay now,
with a lot of chaps running them who don&#8217;t know
any more than to turn on the gasoline and switch
on the spark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And girls, too,&#8221; added another of the men.
&#8220;Though I must say there are some girls here
who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy there!&#8221; called one of the rescuers
sharply.
</p>
<p>He might have been speaking to his companion,
who was attending to the fastening of the towing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
rope, but to Jack it seemed as though there was an
injunction to be careful of what was said.
</p>
<p>Somehow or other, though why he could not
tell, Jack&#8217;s suspicions were aroused. He tried to
get a good look at the faces of the men, but the
moon was hidden behind some clouds just then,
and it was out of the question. The light was
too baffling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;re ready,&#8221; announced the
man who was making fast the towing rope. &#8220;Now
where do you fellows want to go? We can&#8217;t
promise to take you home, as we have some business
of our own to attend to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack always said, afterward, that nothing could
have been more providential than the way the
moon shone out brightly just as he was about to
reply.
</p>
<p>He had it on the tip of his tongue to ask that,
if possible, they be landed near Denny&#8217;s cabin,
when a ray of moonlight glinted on the name of
the rescuing boat, painted on her stern. There
Jack read the word:
</p>
<p><i>Pickerel.</i>
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he almost ejaculated aloud.
&#8220;The boat that raced with Cora! The same men
who are after old Denny!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack made up his mind in a flash. It would
never do for the men to know that he and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
friends were on their way to save Denny from the
very fate the men had in store for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you can land us anywhere near Buler&#8217;s
Pavilion, it will answer,&#8221; said Jack, naming a place
not far from the entrance to the bay, and not far
from where they were at that moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buler&#8217;s Pavilion!&#8221; cried Ed. &#8220;Why
that&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably closed, by this time, I know
that!&#8221; answered Jack, quickly, giving Ed a sly
kick. &#8220;But we can get somebody up, I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, in a tense whisper he hissed into Ed&#8217;s
ear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the men after Denny. I know them
by their boat. Don&#8217;t let on who we are. We&#8217;re
going to Buler&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, we can rouse somebody up if they are
closed,&#8221; answered Ed, quickly falling in with
Jack&#8217;s scheme. &#8220;That will do us, all right,&#8221; he
added to the men. &#8220;That is, if it won&#8217;t be too
much out of your way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said one. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be glad to leave
you there. Maybe you can find somebody to fix
your boat. All ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go,&#8221; said Jack. He wanted the
<i>Pickerel</i> to get far enough ahead so that he could
talk to his chums without the danger of being overheard.
</p>
<p>The engine of the rescuing boat was set going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
more rapidly, and the clutch was thrown in. The
craft forged ahead, and soon the <i>Dixie</i> was under
way again. She was being brought back from the
sea which had so nearly claimed her, and in a
strange manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you want to say we&#8217;d like to be
landed at Buler&#8217;s?&#8221; asked Dray of Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want to fool these fellows,&#8221; and
Jack quickly told how he had seen the name of the
boat that had raced with his sister&#8217;s. &#8220;If we do
land there,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;they won&#8217;t know who
we are. We can tell them to cut us off before we
get to the dock, in case the place should happen
to be open and lighted up. Then they can&#8217;t see
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Dray. &#8220;You&#8217;re a wise boy,
Jack.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw that name in time,&#8221; went on Cora&#8217;s
brother. &#8220;Otherwise it would have been all up
with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about Denny?&#8221; asked Ed. &#8220;How
are we going to save him if we land at Buler&#8217;s,
and let these fellows go on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have to get another boat, if we can, and go to
Denny&#8217;s cabin in her. The <i>Dixie</i> is no good.
Oh, excuse me!&#8221; he said quickly to Dray. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean that&mdash;exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, old man, the <i>Dixie</i> is certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
no good to-night. Say all you please about her,
you can&#8217;t hurt my feelings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If only the <i>Reliance</i> is at Buler&#8217;s we can get
her and go to the cabin flying,&#8221; went on Jack. &#8220;If
not, we&#8217;ll do the best we can. Maybe Denny can
stand them off until we arrive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what&#8217;s the matter with up and telling
these fellows we know who they are, and who we
are,&#8221; suggested Walter. &#8220;We can tell them we
know what they&#8217;re up to, and threaten them.
Won&#8217;t that stop them from bothering Denny&mdash;at
least to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; returned Jack, quickly. &#8220;Do
you know what they&#8217;d do as soon as they found out
who we were?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d know at once we were working against
them, and they&#8217;d cut us adrift. Then we would
be out of it. And I haven&#8217;t any desire,&#8221; added
Jack, with a shrug of his shoulders, &#8220;to go out to
sea again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We land at Buler&#8217;s,&#8221; said Walter, decidedly.
</p>
<p>And a little later they landed at that resort,
which had closed unusually early, for some reason.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;cast off!&#8221; Jack had called as they
neared the dock, and the <i>Dixie</i>, with trailing rope,
ran up to it under her own momentum, while the
other craft swung off into the darkness, the boys
calling their thanks to the men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if they only knew who it was they had
given a tow to!&#8221; chuckled Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll know, soon enough,&#8221; replied Jack.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to look up a boat to take us to Denny
Shane&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve simply got to get there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while the boys were thus looking for a
boat to take the place of the disabled <i>Dixie</i>, the
plotters, in their swift <i>Pickerel</i>, were hastening
toward the little cove where the fisherman&#8217;s cabin
stood.
</p>
<p>The men in the boat were Moran, the slow-moving
character whom Cora had seen in the
store; Bruce, the &#8220;society&#8221; chap; Kelly, a blunt
and unscrupulous Irishman, who handled the
money for the factory interests, and a man to run
the boat. He had been brought in at the last
minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost a lot of time, towing those chumps,&#8221;
grumbled Moran, as the <i>Pickerel</i> forged ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we were early,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
a man keeping watch on Shane&#8217;s shack, and he was
late getting in. He telephoned to me. It&#8217;s just
as well to let Shane get a bit settled before we
tackle him. He was out fishing until long after
dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the engineer slowed down the powerful
motor as they came up to the dock.
</p>
<p>It was this sound that Cora and her chums
heard.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>CORA&#8217;S BRAVE RESOLVE</h3>
</div>

<p>When the girls heard Cora&#8217;s remark, that the
approaching motor boat might contain the boys,
Lottie said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re all right now!&#8221; and she sighed in
relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much you depend on them!&#8221; observed
Belle, in a low voice. &#8220;When you&#8217;ve been with
us a little longer you&#8217;ll learn that we can do almost
as well by ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am glad the boys have arrived,&#8221; agreed
Cora. &#8220;I never was so pleased to know that they
were on hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But a moment later, as they saw the forms of
four men leaving the motor boat, which had been
made fast to the dock, Cora shrank back, at the
same time whispering a warning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, something is wrong! Those aren&#8217;t the
boys. Quick, get out of sight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pulled Bess behind a row of bushes, and the
others followed silently. They had started down
to the beach from the cabin, but fortunately managed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to conceal themselves in time. The men,
walking up the little slope toward the cabin, had
not seen them.
</p>
<p>Trembling with nervousness, Cora and her
chums awaited the new turn of events. That it
would come soon seemed likely, for the men appeared
bent on something. They had made fast
their boat, and came up the slope openly, as
though their errand was the most innocent in the
world. The light still glowed in the cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cora!&#8221; gasped Marita. &#8220;Suppose they
do&mdash;&mdash;do something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is very likely they will do,&#8221; replied
Cora. &#8220;But don&#8217;t talk&mdash;I want to watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From behind the screen of bushes Cora watched
the men coming forward. The moon still gave a
good light, though it was declining in the west.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he there?&#8221; Cora heard one of the men ask.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to be&mdash;there&#8217;s a light going, anyhow,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather found him in
bed, but we can&#8217;t have all we want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where are the boys!&#8221; cried Bess, frantically.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Cora. &#8220;Surely
they should have been here. But there must be a
good reason why they are not. Jack wouldn&#8217;t
disappoint us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you include Walter and the
others?&#8221; asked Belle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you know I meant them,&#8221; Cora retorted.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it&mdash;really I can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are in hiding,&#8221; ventured Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d have been out before this, if they
were,&#8221; declared Cora.
</p>
<p>There came a sudden knock. It was one of
the men striking on the door of Denny&#8217;s cabin.
From their hiding place in the bushes the girls
heard it plainly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; whispered Cora.
</p>
<p>They heard the voice of the old fisherman call:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there? What do you want at this time
of night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to see you,&#8221; was answered in
tones Cora recognized as those of the young man
who had raced with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; inquired Denny. &#8220;I have no
fish to sell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we don&#8217;t want fish,&#8221; was the retort.
&#8220;Come, Shane, open your door. We want to talk
to you. It&#8217;s important, and there may be something
in it for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;trouble, more or less. I can&#8217;t see anything
else,&#8221; was the grumbling response. &#8220;Wait
a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora looked over the bushes. She could see
the men grouped in front of the cabin door. Then
she saw it open, and a broad beam of light shoot
out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; invited Denny, and the plotters entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s our chance!&#8221; exclaimed Cora, her
heart beating rapidly. &#8220;We must see what those
men do. We may have to give evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; sighed Marita. &#8220;I never could
do it. I&#8217;d faint, sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; asked Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. You won&#8217;t have to do anything
hard, dear,&#8221; was the gentle answer, as Cora
slipped her arm about the timid girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do anything you girls do,&#8221; was the
quick answer. &#8220;I want to help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we want your help,&#8221; whispered Bess.
&#8220;But, Cora, can&#8217;t we go closer? We ought to
look in and see what happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave Bess!&#8221; murmured Lottie. &#8220;You are
certainly coming on finely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plotters were now inside the cabin, so that
it was safe for the girls to advance. This they
did until they were once more in a position where
they could look in the window of the cabin.
</p>
<p>They saw a strange sight. Old Denny Shane,
brave and rugged, confronted the four men who
had called on him. In one hand he grasped the
red oar, while the other rested on the back of the
chair from which he had risen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Shane,&#8221; said the man Cora knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
as Bruce. &#8220;We come to see you on business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind?&#8221; asked the old man, and the girls
could see him look around as though seeking help
or a means of escape. But there was no fear in
his eyes. Only defiance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well get to business at once,&#8221;
said one of the men, sharply. That was Kelly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Moran. &#8220;Make him
an offer. If he doesn&#8217;t want to take it then we&#8217;ll
talk another kind of talk. And be quick about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want no business with you!&#8221; cried Denny,
sharply. &#8220;Why do you come here bothering me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know why!&#8221; exclaimed Bruce. &#8220;You
are concerned in the Lewis land matter. You can
testify as to who owns it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, supposin&#8217; I can?&#8221; asked the old man,
defiantly. &#8220;What is that to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots to us, and it may mean a great deal to
you, also!&#8221; snapped out Kelly. &#8220;You may have
some papers, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may,&#8221; returned Denny, &#8220;but you&#8217;ll not get
&#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and the others, listening, knew that Denny
would only be too glad if he did have the documents
in question. But the girls had heard him
lamenting that he did not know where they were.
</p>
<p>Why did he now let the men think he did know?
It was a puzzle to the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not get them, eh?&#8221; cried Bruce. &#8220;That&#8217;s to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
be seen. Now look here, Shane. We came here
to do business, and we&#8217;re going to do it. By fair
means if we can, if not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused suggestively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I know you and your breed!&#8221; cried the
old fisherman. &#8220;By fair means or foul! But
try it on! I&#8217;m not afraid of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stepped back a pace, the better to defend
himself in case he had to. The red oar was still
in his firm hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now wait a minute,&#8221; put in Moran. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
try the fair means first. What do you say to that?
Show him the bills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a quick gesture Bruce drew out a roll of
greenbacks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you go, Shane!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a cool hundred here, and it&#8217;s yours if you testify
that the Widow Lewis has no claim on the land.
And she hasn&#8217;t any claim that she can prove. All
we want you to testify to is that her husband&#8217;s
father sold the land some time before his death.
We&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t sell it!&#8221; cried Denny. &#8220;It was
his on his dyin&#8217; day, and it belongs to his son&#8217;s
widder and daughter now. That&#8217;s the law, an&#8217;
you know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t prove that the land is hers,&#8221; sneered
Kelly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she can,&#8221; returned Denny, quietly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she can&#8217;t unless you tell what you
know,&#8221; broke in Bruce. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found out that
much. Now the factory wants that land, and it&#8217;s
going to get it. Here, I&#8217;ll make it a hundred and
fifty if you do as we want you to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; testify to a lie?&#8221; cried Denny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be exactly a lie. Besides, we&#8217;re
willing to pay the widow a small sum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not what the land&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s valuable
property,&#8221; insisted Denny, &#8220;and it will keep her
in her old age if she manages right. Be off with
you! I&#8217;ll stick to the Widder Lewis, so I will. Be
off!&#8221; and he motioned them to the door. &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t have got this close if it hadn&#8217;t been that
my dog was dead. Be off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; Cora and her chums heard
Bruce say. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t said all we intend to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure something will happen now,&#8221;
quavered Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; cautioned Cora. &#8220;We must do something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do something?&#8221; questioned Marita. &#8220;Oh,
why don&#8217;t the boys come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cora and her chums were close to the cabin
now. They could look in the door, and through
the uncurtained window, and see plainly all that
went on. They could also hear plainly, for the
men and old Denny spoke loudly. And, as yet,
the girls had not been noticed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look here!&#8221; said Bruce, and there was
a snarl in his voice. &#8220;This is our last offer, Shane.
Either you take the hundred and fifty dollars, and
testify the way we want you to, or we&#8217;ll find means
to make you, and you won&#8217;t get the money. And
I&#8217;ll say this, that we&#8217;ll treat the Widow Lewis as
fair as we can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which won&#8217;t be fair at all!&#8221; burst out Denny.
&#8220;Not at all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s your answer?&#8221; cried Kelly.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay here all night. Give him the
money, Bruce. When he feels it he&#8217;ll hate to let
it go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bruce held out the roll of bills. To the surprise
of Cora and the girls the fisherman took
them. Was he going to betray Freda and her
mother?
</p>
<p>The next instant they knew Denny for the
brave-souled man he was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me answer!&#8221; he cried, throwing the
bills in the face of Bruce. &#8220;Take your evil money
and get out. I&#8217;ll stick to the widder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment the men were nonplussed. Then,
with an angry exclamation, Bruce started forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, girls,&#8221; said Cora, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to go
to the aid of Denny. For some reason the boys
aren&#8217;t here. We&#8217;ve got to save him!&#8221; and with
this brave resolve she moved toward the cabin.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE RED OAR AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Cora Kimball, what are you going to do?&#8221;
gasped Lottie, trying to hold back her chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to Denny&#8217;s aid. Why
shouldn&#8217;t I? It&#8217;s four to one, but even if we are
girls we can perhaps turn the tide in his favor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Cora, I don&#8217;t dare!&#8221; admitted Belle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; added her plump sister. &#8220;I&#8217;ll faint
if you go in where those horrid men are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Faint if you like,&#8221; returned Cora, calmly.
&#8220;Somebody else will have to look after you, then,
for I&#8217;m going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; asked Lottie. &#8220;We ought not to
interfere when men are going to fight, and I think
that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen in there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; said Cora,
&#8220;but perhaps we can prevent it. For some unknown
reason, though the boys promised to come
here and defend Denny, they haven&#8217;t done so.
Therefore, it&#8217;s our place to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;m going with you!&#8221; announced
Marita, determinedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>All this talk had taken but a few seconds of
time, and, as it had been in whispers, the men in
the cabin had not heard it. The situation, however,
was rapidly becoming acute.
</p>
<p>With one accord, after Bruce had stepped toward
old Denny, the others advanced. They were
evidently going to lay violent hands on him. But
the sturdy fisherman was not afraid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Stand back or I&#8217;ll
do you harm&mdash;you cowards!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No use calling names!&#8221; sneered Kelly.
&#8220;We&#8217;re here to do you. We made you a fair
offer, and you wouldn&#8217;t take it. Now you&#8217;ll have
to abide by the consequences.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get behind him,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;I can take him
from where I stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back! Get out of here!&#8221; ordered the old
man.
</p>
<p>He raised the red oar over his head, threateningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grab him!&#8221; cried Moran. &#8220;Grab that oar!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get it over the head before you grab
it!&#8221; threatened Denny. &#8220;Mind that, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fisherman swung his weapon, but he either
had not calculated on the length of it, or he forgot
that he was nearer to the wall than he had been at
first. The blade of the oar caught in a hanging
picture, and was entangled in the wire.
</p>
<p>Denny, putting all his strength into the blow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
he had hoped would disable one of his assailants,
was thrown off his balance. He toppled and nearly
fell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; yelled Kelly.
</p>
<p>The cowardly men, attacking the single fisherman
with overwhelming numbers, made a leap
forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! Let him alone. We&#8217;ll call the police!&#8221;
screamed Cora, and the other girls added their
shrill voices to hers. They rushed into the cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls I raced with!&#8221; muttered Bruce.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve no time to fool with them. Don&#8217;t mind
them. Get at Shane!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get at me, is it?&#8221; cried the fisherman. He
had by this time disentangled the oar from the
picture wire. Again he raised it over his head,
intending to bring it down on Kelly.
</p>
<p>As the red weapon descended Kelly shot up his
hand and caught it. He twisted on the oar to
wrest it from Denny&#8217;s grasp, and the two suddenly
went to the floor, jarring the whole cabin.
</p>
<p>And at that instant there was a sound of splintering,
breaking wood. Some red slivers flew out
from between the two prostrate men who were
struggling for possession of the weapon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The red oar! It&#8217;s broken!&#8221; cried Denny.
&#8220;Me old red oar, that saved me life in the hands
of Grandfather Lewis! The red oar is broken,
bad luck to you! Cowards that you are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>The girls were screaming, but even Cora, brave
as she was, dared go no nearer to the two desperately
struggling men. Bruce and Moran were
seeking an opening that they might get hold of
Denny. The fourth man had gone back to the
boat, seemingly. He had leaped out of the window
as the girls entered.
</p>
<p>The cabin was a place of wild excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that oar away from him!&#8221; cried Bruce.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s some rope. Tie him up, and then we&#8217;ll
get what we want out of him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare hurt him!&#8221; screamed Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, would you?&#8221; gasped Denny, as he rolled
out from under Kelly, who had sought to pass a
rope about the old man&#8217;s wrists. &#8220;I&#8217;m not down
and out yet!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;The red oar is broken,
but I&#8217;ve got the best end yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He staggered to his feet, holding the handle of
the red oar. One end was splintered where it had
been broken from the blade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! I&#8217;m not afraid!&#8221; yelled Denny.
&#8220;Come on. You girls had better leave&mdash;&mdash;there&#8217;s
going to be trouble!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t go! Help is on the way. The boys
are coming!&#8221; cried Cora, though she did not know
when Jack and the others would arrive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if they were only here now! When we
need them so!&#8221; gasped Lottie.
</p>
<p>Again Denny swung what was left of the red
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
oar around his head. He aimed a blow at the
face of Bruce, but it fell short and struck the man
on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened. The handle
of the oar split lengthwise, and from a hollow
place inside there flew out a roll of papers, yellow
with age. And on one of them was a red seal&mdash;a
legal-looking seal.
</p>
<p>Bruce staggered at the blow, and a strange look
came over his face. It might have been that he was
dazed, but his eyes lighted on the roll of papers
that had fallen to the floor. There they lay&mdash;a
curious roll that had come from the secret crevice
in the red oar.
</p>
<p>The struggle had come to a sudden end. The
girls ceased screaming and stood looking on
dumbly, unable to understand what had happened.
</p>
<p>As for the men they, too, seemed startled by
the strange turn of events. Kelly rose to his feet,
and was creeping up on Denny from behind. His
arms were outstretched, and his fingers worked
convulsively, as though they would like to close
about the fisherman&#8217;s throat, and force him to
testify as the plotters desired.
</p>
<p>Cora wanted to scream a warning, but some
strange force seemed to hold her dumb.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The red oar&mdash;it&#8217;s broken&mdash;broken! Me old
red oar, that saved me life!&#8221; murmured Denny
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Shane. &#8220;But I never knew &#8217;twas hollow. Never!
I wonder did Grandfather Lewis&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not complete the sentence, for at that
instant Bruce leaped forward and caught up the
roll of yellow papers from the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me those!&#8221; cried Denny leaping at him
with the jagged piece of the red oar in his gnarled
hands&mdash;the hands that had, so many years ago,
grasped the same oar in what was little short of
a death-grip. &#8220;Give me those papers!&#8221; fairly
roared Denny. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what they are, but
they&#8217;re not yours. Give &#8217;em to me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give you these! I guess not!&#8221; sneered Bruce.
&#8220;They are just what we want&mdash;the land papers.
They&#8217;re the only ones by which the widow could
prove her shadowy claim to the property, and with
them out of the way it&#8217;s all clear sailing for us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the luckiest thing that could have happened
for us! The breaking of the red oar came
at the right time. Kelly, give me a match and
we&#8217;ll make a little bonfire of these same papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; cried Denny, and, making a
leap forward he snatched from Kelly&#8217;s hands the
precious documents that had so strangely come
from the secret hiding place in the red oar.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE DISCOVERY&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>Wild with rage the three men with one accord
made a leap for Denny Shane. But the old fisherman
was not to be easily taken. Holding the precious
papers close to him, he made a jump for a
corner of the room, where hung an old musket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s going to shoot!&#8221; screamed Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And small blame to him if he did,&#8221; declared
Cora. &#8220;Oh, those men must not destroy those
papers, if I have to take them in charge myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Denny Shane had reached the corner where
hung his musket. It was not loaded. Cora knew
this, for the old fisherman had said he was always
afraid of some accident happening, and he never
kept a charge in the gun. It was for the effect of
it, he said, that he had it hanging on his wall.
Now it would be useful as a club, at least&mdash;more
useful than the easily shattered red oar had
been.
</p>
<p>But before Denny could reach the gun Kelly
was upon him. With a fierce motion the desperate
plotter grasped the fisherman around the neck.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
Holding him thus with one arm, he snatched the
papers from him with his other hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you go!&#8221; Kelly cried to Bruce. &#8220;Take
the papers while I hold him. Burn &#8217;em if you
want to, but be sure you do the job well! Then
we&#8217;d better get out of here. I think I hear a boat
coming. This place will soon be too hot for us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bruce took the papers from his crony. Hastily
scanning them, to make sure he had the right ones,
he struck a match that Moran handed him.
</p>
<p>Kelly and Denny were struggling in the corner
of the room. But poor old Denny had not much
strength left. The events of the night had been
too much for him, and he was giving way under the
cruel pressure of Kelly&#8217;s arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the very papers we want&mdash;or don&#8217;t
want, rather!&#8221; exulted Bruce. &#8220;With them out
of the way the property is ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The match flickered in his fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare burn them!&#8221; cried Cora.
</p>
<p>One corner of the papers had caught fire.
</p>
<p>Then from without the cabin sounded a chorus
of cries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just in time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls are here ahead of us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were the voices of Jack and his chums.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the boys have come! The boys have
come!&#8221; cried Lottie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack! Jack! In here! Quick!&#8221; screamed
Cora. &#8220;He&#8217;s burning the papers! Get them
from him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Into the cabin, already crowded, the boys flung
themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in time!&#8221; cried Cora, motioning to Jack.
&#8220;Get those papers from him before they burn!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over in the corner poor Denny had fallen unconscious
under the attack of Kelly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it and run!&#8221; advised Moran, making for
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; shouted Walter, blocking it.
&#8220;Guard the windows, Dray&mdash;Ed!&#8221; he called.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers! The papers!&#8221; voiced Cora.
&#8220;Get them before they burn, or Mrs. Lewis will
lose the land!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get them!&#8221; shouted Jack.
</p>
<p>He flung himself upon Bruce as he had often
flung himself upon a player in tackling him on the
football field.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for yourself!&#8221; threatened Bruce.
</p>
<p>But Jack was not afraid. He twisted himself
about Bruce, and sought to reach the papers.
</p>
<p>Bruce, to get them out of Jack&#8217;s reach, held
them high in the air, over his head. The two
were struggling. Moran and Kelly were wrestling
with Ed and Walter, while the other girls
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
cowered behind Dray, who had caught up a chair
as a weapon.
</p>
<p>Cora saw her chance. She slipped around behind
Bruce, and with a leap that had often enabled
her to outwit an opponent in playing basket ball,
the plucky motor girl snatched the papers from
the man&#8217;s hand. Full and clean was her jump,
and the smouldering papers came away in her
grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have them, Jack!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Look out
for the men!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And with that, to make sure that she would not
lose the precious documents, Cora held them
tightly under her arm and ran out of the cabin
door, after putting out the little blaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All over!&#8221; cried Jack, putting out his foot,
and tripping up Bruce, who aimed a savage blow
at him. &#8220;All over!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bruce went down heavily. At the same time,
from without the cabin there flashed several lights,
and the voices of men were heard asking:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been screaming?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plotters gathered together. Bruce leaped
from the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried desperately. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
up. Get away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He leaped out of the window, followed by the
other two.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get them!&#8221; yelled Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let them go&mdash;it&#8217;s the easiest way,&#8221; advised
Jack. &#8220;Cora has the papers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe they&#8217;ve hurt Denny!&#8221; said Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; asserted the fisherman, as he
slowly arose. &#8220;He just cut off my wind for a
minute. I&#8217;m all right. But where are the
papers?&#8221; and he looked about the floor, on which
were scattered pieces of the broken red oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re safe,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;Cora, my
sister, has them. Guess we&#8217;d better look for her
though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no need, as Cora, holding the papers
in her hand, re-entered the cabin at that moment.
Only one edge of the legal documents was burned,
and no real harm had been done.
</p>
<p>While the motor girls, and the boys and the
neighboring men, who had come to the rescue all
but too late, were looking at one another there
was heard, at the dock, the puffing of a motor
boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go!&#8221; exclaimed Walter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the best way,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;re
glad to get rid of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you girls get here?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How was it you boys <i>didn&#8217;t</i> get here?&#8221; demanded
Cora, still panting from her exertions.
</p>
<p>Explanations were then in order. I will be as
brief with them as I can. How the girls came to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
go to the cabin is already known. And how the
boys, foolishly perhaps, went out on the bay while
waiting for Denny to come back, and how they
became stalled, is likewise known to my readers.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Denny came to his cabin.
</p>
<p>Then came the unexpected help in the shape of
a tow from the plotters themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They left us at Buler&#8217;s,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;and then
we had our own troubles. We tried to get a boat
to come on, for the <i>Dixie</i> still refused to move.
But we couldn&#8217;t get one for love or money, and it
was too rough to row.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221; asked Cora, looking at
Denny, who was examining the broken red oar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We hired a horse and carriage, and came
around the land way,&#8221; replied Walter. &#8220;It took
us a long time, too, for we missed the road.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we finally got here,&#8221; spoke Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And just in time,&#8221; added Cora. &#8220;We were
wild about you&mdash;couldn&#8217;t imagine what happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get the note we left pinned to the
door?&#8221; asked Dray of Denny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary a note,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Later it was found where it had blown into a
clump of bushes. So that accounted for Denny&#8217;s
not being warned in time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But everything seems to be coming out right,&#8221;
said Cora, with a rather wintry smile. All the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
girls were pale, and a trifle weak. The boys, too,
were tired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are those papers?&#8221; asked Jack, taking
them from Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those prove Mrs. Lewis&#8217;s title to the land
the plotters tried to get,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so
glad we found them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who found them?&#8221; asked Walter, giving
Cora&#8217;s hand a surreptitious squeeze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were in the red oar,&#8221; said Denny. &#8220;And
to think I never knew it! They were there all
these years, and all of us worrying about them and
wondering where they were. But I understand
now. Grandfather Lewis must have hollowed out
a hole in the handle, hid the papers in it, and then
plugged it up. Then he gave the oar to me to
keep. I remember well at the time he said it would
prove valuable some day. I often wondered what
made the oar lighter than it had been. It was
because it was hollowed out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked him what he meant by sayin&#8217; the oar
was valuable, but he kept puttin&#8217; me off. He said
he&#8217;d tell me some time, but he never did. Then
the day he died he sent for me, and was trying to
tell me, I guess, but he couldn&#8217;t. I remember I
wondered what was on his mind, but he was too
weak to explain. So he died with his secret, and
the red oar had it and kept it all these years.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the oar broke, or those men and myself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
broke it between us, and the papers fell out. Now
the widder will get her rights.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the Widow Lewis did. Leaving the valuable
documents with Denny, the motor girls and
the boys went back to their stopping places&mdash;the
girls to the bungalow, the boys to the tent.
</p>
<p>And such a time as Cora and her chums had in
telling the good news to Mrs. Lewis and Freda!
The latter could hardly believe it at first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how can we ever thank you!&#8221; cried Freda,
as, with tears in her eyes, she embraced Cora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try,&#8221; was the whispered answer.
</p>
<p>And so everything came out right after all. The
papers so oddly hidden in the red oar proved the
widow&#8217;s title to the valuable land beyond the
shadow of a doubt. As for the plotters, they were
not seen again in that part of the country. They
realized that the sharp trick they had tried to
play had failed, thanks to the activities of Cora
and her friends.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lewis easily established her claim to the
land, moved back to her cottage, and the project
of spoiling the public park was abandoned. The
factory company was beaten in court and the members
of the corporation were forced to pay heavy
costs.
</p>
<p>Old Denny came in for his share of credit, and
he was very happy. His one lament was that the
red oar was broken, but he managed to patch it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
together, after a fashion. And the motor girls
got him another dog.
</p>
<p>The opening by which the papers had been put
in the hollow handle had been cleverly concealed,
and, only for the accidental breaking of the oar,
might never have been discovered.
</p>
<p>It had probably been the intention of Grandfather
Lewis to disclose the secret hiding place of
the land papers, but he had died before he could
do this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8216;all&#8217;s well that ends well,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Cora
the next day, at a late breakfast. &#8220;We have done
a little good here by our vacation at Crystal Bay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>little</i> good!&#8221; exclaimed Freda. &#8220;I never
can thank you enough, Cora.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll soon have to go back home&mdash;that&#8217;s
the worst of it!&#8221; sighed Lottie. &#8220;It is so lovely
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, we can come back next year,&#8221; spoke
Bess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, too, Winter&#8217;s coming on&mdash;something
is sure to happen then,&#8221; added Belle.
&#8220;Something always does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And what did happen that Winter will be told
of in the volume to follow this, which will be
called &#8220;The Motor Girls on Waters Blue; Or,
The Strange Cruise of the <i>Tartar</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the next day. The girls disposed themselves
about the bungalow in picturesque attitudes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
and the boys sat on the broad porch, telling over
again the adventures of the night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one point we&#8217;re shy on,&#8221; said
Jack, when everything had been told and retold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s what?&#8221; asked Ed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t found out yet who the strange
woman was who tried to get information out of
Freda, and who sent her the &#8217;phone message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re just as well off without knowing
that,&#8221; said Cora. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure she was in with the
plotters. You know that man Bruce called her
&#8216;Confidence Kate,&#8217; as if he knew her well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have been terribly frightened, when
you found out there was no way of getting home
from the Junction,&#8221; said Marita. &#8220;I think I
should have gone out of my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe her, Freda,&#8221; laughed Cora, putting
her arm around the timid girl. &#8220;Marita is
braver than she thinks. She offered to go into the
cabin with me when those horrid men were there,
and none of the others would.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on over to Buler&#8217;s and see &#8217;em dance,&#8221;
proposed Jack. &#8220;The <i>Dixie</i> is running again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go in the <i>Chelton</i>,&#8221; spoke Cora firmly,
and in that boat they went. And now for a time,
we will take leave of the motor girls.
